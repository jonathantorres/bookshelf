- Put 6 coins on each side of the scale, one side will be heavier.
- Use the heavier side from the first weighing and put 3 coins on each side of the scale.
- Using the heavier side from the 2nd weighing, pick 2 coins and put 1 on each side of the scale.
- If the scale is balanced then the coin you didn't weigh is the heavier one. Otherwise, the scale will show which one of the other 2 is the heavy coin.
