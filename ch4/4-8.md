*4.8 - Given a set of `S` containing `n` real numbers, and a real number `x`. We seek an algorithm to determine whether two elements of `S` exist whose sum is exactly `x`.*
- *Assume that `S` is unsorted. Give an `O(n log n)` algorithm for the problem.*
- *Assume that `S` is sorted. Give an `O(n)` algorithm for the problem.*
***
- Sort the set `S`, go through each and compare the current element plus the next one against `x`.
- Same as the previous answer, but it's already sorted.
