*4.26 - Consider the problem of sorting a sequence of `n 0's` and `1's` using comparisons. For each comparison of two values `x` and `y`, the algorithm learns which of `x<y`, `x=y`, or `x>y` holds:*
- *Give an algorithm to sort in `nâˆ’1` comparisons in the worst case. Show that your algorithm is optimal.*
- *Give an algorithm to sort in `2n/3` comparisons in the average case (assuming each of the `n` inputs is `0` or `1` with equal probability). Show that your algorithm is optimal.*
***
- Go through each item in the list and make the comparisons, since we are comparing zeros and ones then the last item does not need to be compared. Resulting in `n-1` comparisons.
- Go through each item in the list and move or swap the item to the leftmost position of all zeroes if it's zero, and move to the right if it's a one.
