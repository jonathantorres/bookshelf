*4.23 - We seek to sort a sequence `S` of `n` integers with many duplications, such that the number of distinct integers in `S` is `O(log n)`. Give an `O(n log log n)` worst-case time algorithm to sort such sequences.*
***
- This can be achieved by using a self balanced binary tree.
- Keep a count of duplicates on each insertions on the tree.
- The tree is not going to be greated than `log n` elements.
