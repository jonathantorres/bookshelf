*4.27 -  Let `P` be a simple, but not necessarily convex, polygon and `q` an arbitrary point not necessarily in `P`. Design an efficient algorithm to find a line segment originating from `q` that intersects the maximum number of edges of `P`. In other words, if standing at point `q`, in what direction should you aim a gun so the bullet will go through the largest number of walls. A bullet through a vertex of `P` gets credit for only one wall. An `O(n log n)` algorithm is possible.*
***
- Keep a list of the line segments, with points stored as pairs of angles relative to `q`, and sort them by the minimum of the two angles.
- Iterate through the sorted list of minimum elements, incrementing a counter whenever the start of a line segment is encountered, and decrementing the counter whenever a line segment ends.
