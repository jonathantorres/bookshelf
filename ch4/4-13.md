*4.13 - You wish to store a set of `n` numbers in either a max-heap or a sorted array. For each application below, state which data structure is better, or if it does not matter. Explain your answers.*
- *Want to find the maximum element quickly.*
- *Want to be able to delete an element quickly.*
- *Want to be able to form the structure quickly.*
- *Want to find the minimum element quickly.*
***
- max-heap, takes `O(log n)`
- Array, `O(1)` as long as we have the index
- Doesn't matter
- Array, `O(1)`, just get the first element
