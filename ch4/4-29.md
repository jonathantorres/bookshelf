*4.29 - Mr. B. C. Dull claims to have developed a new data structure for priority queues that supports the operations `Insert`, `Maximum`, and `Extract-Max`, all in `O(1)` worst-case time. Prove that he is mistaken. (Hint: the argument does not involve a lot of gory details---just think about what this would imply about the `Î©(n log n)` lower bound for sorting.)*
***
- Impossible since trees are used for priority queues that run in `O(log(n))` time.
- If this claim was true one could construct a linear time sorting algorithm by inserting all elements and then extracting all maximum elements again. Since the lower bound of `O(n log n)` for searching this is not possible.
