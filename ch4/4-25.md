*4.25 - Assume that the array `A[1..n]` only has numbers from `{1,â€¦,n2}` but that at most `log log n` of these numbers ever appear. Devise an algorithm that sorts `A`in substantially less than `O(n log n)`.*
***
- The array will therefore consist of only very few distinct numbers and all others will be repetitions.
- Iterate through the original array and create two auxiliary arrays of numbers `A` and their repetition count `N`. This is done in `O(n)`.
- Sort the two arrays, comparing keys from `A`.
- Recreate the final sorted array by taking every number in `A` and repeat it `n` times. This can be done in `O(n)`.
