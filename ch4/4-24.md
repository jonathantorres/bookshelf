*4.24 - Let `A[1..n]` be an array such that the first `n−n√` elements are already sorted (though we know nothing about the remaining elements). Give an algorithm that sorts `A` in substantially better than `n log n` steps.*
***
- Sort the elements from `A[n√+1]` to `A[n]`, this should be better than `O(n log n)`.
