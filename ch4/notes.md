## Chapter 4 - Notes
- Sorting lies at the heart of many algorithms. Sorting the data is one of the first things any algorithm designer should try in the quest for efficiency.
- Sorting can be used to illustrate most algorithm design paradigms. Data structure techniques, divide and conquer, randomization, and incremental construction all lead to efficient sorting algorithms.
- Binary search and its variants are the quintessential divide and conquer algorithms.
