*4.6 - Given two sets `S1` and `S2` (each of size `n`), and a number `x`, describe an `O(n log n)` algorithm for finding whether there exists a pair of elements, one from `S1` and one from `S2`, that add up to `x`. (For partial credit, give a `Î˜(n2)` algorithm for this problem.)*
***
- An `O(n^2)` algorithm
```
For i in S1 {
    For j in S2 {
        if i+j == x {
            return (i,j)
        }
    }
}
```
- An `O(n log n)` algorithm, doing binary search
```
- Sort S2
For i in S1 {
    num = x - i
    found = bsearch(S2, num)
    if found {
        return (i, found)
    }
}
```
