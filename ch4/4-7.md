*4.7 - Outline a reasonable method of solving each of the following problems. Give the order of the worst-case complexity of your methods.*
- *You are given a pile of thousands of telephone bills and thousands of checks sent in to pay the bills. Find out who did not pay.*
- *You are given a list containing the title, author, call number and publisher of all the books in a school library and another list of 30 publishers. Find out how many of the books in the library were published by each company.*
- *You are given all the book checkout cards used in the campus library during the past year, each of which contains the name of the person who took out the book. Determine how many distinct people checked out at least one book.*

- Cross reference each bill with a check, this will run in `O(n^2)`
- Go through the list and check if the book is in the publisher list `O(n)`
- Go through the cards, and count the distinct name of students that checked out a book `O(n)`
