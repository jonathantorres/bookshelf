# 38. Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive  Disks (RAIDS)

1. Run the simulator with the different levels

2. They don't seem to change at all

3. Run and experiment with the reverse flag

4. The gap between addresses increases

5. Run the requests on timing mode, experiment

6. It executes faster as the number of disks increases

7. It doesn't increase by much, it seems

8. The difference on performance accross RAID levels is not much, it seems like it mostly the same accross reads/writes
