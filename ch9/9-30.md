*9.30 - A vertex coloring of graph `G=(V, E)` is an assignment of colors to vertices of `V` such that each edge `(x, y)` implies that vertices `x` and `y` are assigned different colors. Give an algorithm for vertex coloring `G` using at most `Δ + 1` colors, where `Δ` is the maximum vertex degree of `G`.*
***
- Resort to backtracking
- Incremental methods are the heuristic of choice for vertex coloring.
- Vertices are colored sequentially, with the colors chosen in response to colors already assigned in the vertex neighborhood.
- Insert the vertices in nonincreasing order of degree, since high-degree vertices have more color constraints and so are most likely to require an additional color if inserted late.
- Incremental methods can be further improved by using color interchange.
