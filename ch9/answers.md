## 9. Scheduling: Proportional Share (Answers)
1.
- 1 Seed: Job 0 done at time 2, Job 1 done at time 12, Job 2 done at time 6.
- 2 Seeds: Job 0 done at time 14, Job 1 done at time 22, Job 2 done at time 23.
- 3 Seeds: Job 0 done at time 5, Job 1 done at time 4, Job 2 done at time 11.

2. The job with just 1 ticket, will get run at the end, basically after job 0 completes.

3. Both jobs will be done close to the end of the run, they'll be running almost in parallel.

4. The larger the quantum size, the more changes of both jobs from finishing at the same time grows

5. Besides the fairness, I'll guess the trace of each job based on each pass of the scheduler.
