*9.16 - Prove that the following problem is NP-complete:*
- *Problem: Longest Path*
- *Input: A graph `G` and positive integer `k`.*
- *Output: Does `G` contain a path that visits at least `k` different vertices without visiting any vertex more than once?*
***
- I think this is the same problem as the hamiltonian path, but visiting every vertex up until `k` and stopping once the same vertex is visited. If this happens, then the longest path was not found.
