*9.27 - The maximum cut problem for a graph `G=(V, E)` seeks to partition the vertices `V` into disjoint sets `A` and `B` so as to maximize the number of edges `(a, b) ∈ E` such that `a ∈ A` and `b ∈ B`. Consider the following heuristic for max cut. First assign `v[1]` to `A` and `v[2]` to `B`. For each remaining vertex, assign it to the side that adds the most edges to the cut. Prove that this cut is at least half as large as the optimal cut.*
***
It will always be at least as half as large as long as the bigger values are added to it. Which is the side that has the most edges in the cut.
