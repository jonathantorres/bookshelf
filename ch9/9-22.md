*9.22 - The 2-SAT problem is, given a Boolean formula in 2-conjunctive normal form(CNF), to decide whether the formula is satisfiable. 2-SAT is like 3-SAT, except that each clause can have only two literals. For example, the following formula is in 2-CNF:*
```
(x1 ∨ x2) ∧ ( ̄x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (x1 ∨ ̄x3)
```
*Give a polynomial-time algorithm to solve 2-SAT*
***
A 2-SAT can indeed be solved in polynomial time. By grouping together all of the clauses that use the same variable, apply the inference rule to each pair of clauses. By doing this it is possible to find all inferences that are possible from a given 2CNF instance. This can be tested in `O(n^3)`
