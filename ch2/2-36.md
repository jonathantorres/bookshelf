*2.36 - Consider the following code fragment:*  
```
for i=1 to n/2 do
    for j=i to n-i do
        for k=1 to j do
            output "foobar"
```
Assume `n` is even. Let `T(n)` denote the number of times `foobar` is printed as a function of `n`.  
- Express `T(n)` as three nested summations.
- Simplify the summation. Show your work.

Which will output `foobar` 11 times.
