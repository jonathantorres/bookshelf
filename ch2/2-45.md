*2.45 - Consider the following algorithm to find the minimum element in an array of numbers `A[0,...,n]`. One extra variable `tmp` is allocated to hold the current minimum value. Start from `A[0];` "tmp" is compared against `A[1], A[2], ..., A[N]` in order. When `A[i] < tmp`, `tmp = A[i]`. What is the expected number of times that the assignment operation `tmp = A[i]` is performed?*  
***
`n-1` times in the worst case
