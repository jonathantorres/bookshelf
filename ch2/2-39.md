1: It holds  
```
log(xy)  = log x + log y
log(3x5) = log 3 + log 5
log(15)  = log 3 + log 5
3.9      = 1.6 + 2.3
3.9      = 3.9
```
2: It holds  
```
log(x^y) = y log(x)
log(3^5) = 5 log 3
log(243) = 5 x 1.6
8        = 8
```
3: It holds  
```
log x  = log(x)/log(a)
log(3) = log(3)/log(4)
1.6    = 1.6/2
```
