*2.1 - What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a function of `n`. Give the worst-case running time using the Big Oh notation.*  
```
function mystery(n)
	r:=0
	for i:=1 to n-1 do
		for j:=i+1 to n do
			for k:=1 to j do
				r:=r+1
	return(r)
```
***
If you call `mystery(3)` the value returned should be `5`
