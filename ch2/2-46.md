*2.46 - You have a 100-story building and a couple of marbles. You must identify the lowest floor for which a marble will break if you drop it from this floor. How fast can you find this floor if you are given an infinite supply of marbles? What if you have only two marbles?*  
***
- With an infinite supply of marbles, maybe starting from the top, and working my way down `100,99,98,97,...`.
- With only 2 marbles, I'll start on floor 50, and then up to 75 if it doesn't break on the 50th floor. I'll go down on the 35th floor if it does break in the 50th floor.
