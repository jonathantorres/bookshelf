*2.51 - Six pirates must divide $300 dollars among themselves. The division is to proceed as follows. The senior pirate proposes a way to divide the money. Then the pirates vote. If the senior pirate gets at least half the votes he wins, and that division remains. If he doesn't, he is killed and then the next senior-most pirate gets a chance to do the division. Now you have to tell what will happen and why (i.e., how many pirates survive and how the division is done)? All the pirates are intelligent and the first priority is to stay alive and the next priority is to get as much money as possible.*  
***
If the senior pirate divides the money equally `$50 each`, then everyone survives. 

If every following senior pirate is greedy, then the most junior pirate gets all the money, since every other pirate was killed.
