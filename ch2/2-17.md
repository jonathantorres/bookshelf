*2.17 - Show that for any real constants `a` and `b`, `b > 0` Big Oh notation `(n+a)b = Θ(nb)` To show `f(n) = Θ(g(n))`, we must show `O` and `Ω`. Go back to the definition!*  

*Big O -- Must show that `(n+a)b <= c1⋅nb` for all `n > n0`. When is this true? If `c1 = 2b`, this is true for all `n > |a|` since `n+a < 2n`, and raise both sides to the `b`.*  

*Big Ω -- Must show that `(n+a)b >= c2⋅nb` for all `n > n0`. When is this true? If `c2 = (1/2)b`, this is true for all `n > 3|a|/2` since `n+a > n/2`, and raise both sides to the `b`.*
***
Assuming that `a = 2`, `b = 2`, `n = 3` and `c = 3`  
```
(n + a)^b
(3 + 2)^2
(5)^2
= 25
```
```
Θ(n^b)
c * (3^2)
c * 9
3 * 9
= 27
```
Then `(n+a)^b = O(n^b)`  
Yes, it holds for `O(n^b) c = 3` and for `Ω(n^b) c = 2`
