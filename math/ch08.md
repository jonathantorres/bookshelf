## 8. Integers, divisors and primes

#### Notes
- $a|b$ = `b` is a multiple of `a` or `a` divides `b`  

#### 8.1
$a = a \cdot 1 = (-a) \cdot (-1)$  


#### 8.2
a) `a` is even  
b) `a` is odd  
c) `a` is 0  


#### 8.3
a) If $b= a \cdot m$ and $c = a\cdot n$ then $c = a\cdot m \cdot n$  
b) If $b= a \cdot m$ and $c = a \cdot n$ then $b+c=a(m+n)$ and $b-c = a(m-n)$  
c) If $b= a \cdot m$ and $a, b > 0$ then $m>0$, hence $m \geq 1$ and so $b \geq a$  
d) If $b= a \cdot m$ and $a = b \cdot n$ then $a = a \cdot m$, so $m \cdot n = 1$. This means that either $m = n = 1$ or $m = n = -1$  


#### 8.4
We have $a=c \cdot n$ and $b=c \cdot m$ thus $r = b - aq = c(m-nq)$  


#### 8.5
The same as the remainder of the division $c:a$  


#### 8.6
a) $a^2-1=(a-1)(a+1)$  
b) $a^n-1 = (a-1)(a^{n-1}+\dots +a+1)$  


#### 8.7
Yes, `2` is a prime number  


#### 8.8
a) `p` occurs in the prime factorization of `ab`, it must also occur in the prime factorization of `a` or `b`  
b) $p|a(b/a)$, but $p\nmid a$. We must have $p\mid (b/a)$  


#### 8.9
If $n=p_1 p_2 \dots p_k$, each $p_i \geq 2$, $n\geq 2^k$  


#### 8.10
If $r_i = r_j$ then $ia-ja$ is divisible by `p`. But $ia-ja=(i-j)a$ and `a` or $i-j$ are divisible by `p`. This means that $r_i$ are all different  


#### 8.11
If `n` is composite but not a square, then there is a prime `P` that occurs in the prime factorization of `n` an odd number of times  


#### 8.12
There's a prime that ocurrs in the prime factorization of $n$, $t$ times and $k\nmid t$. If $\sqrt[k]{n} = a/b$ then $nb^k = a^k$. If $\sqrt[k]{n}$ is not an integer then it's irrational  


#### 8.13
**TODO**  


#### 8.14
$4\nmid \binom{4}{2} = 6$  
$4\nmid 2^4 - 2 - 14$  


#### 8.15
a) Each of the `p` rotated copies of a set are different. If there is a set that occurs `a` times, then every other set occurs `a` times. But $a\mid p$ so we must have $a=1$ or `p`. If all `p` rotated copies are the same then $k=0$ or $k=p$ which were excluded.  
b) A set of two opposite vertices of a square  
c) If each box contains `p` subsets of size `k`, then the number of subsets is divisible by `k`  


#### 8.16
$a^p-a$ numbers or $p\mid a^p-a$  


#### 8.17
If $gcd(a,p) = 1$. `p` is a divisor of $(p-1)!a^{p-1}-(p-1)! = (p-1)!(a^{p-1}-1)$ since `p` is a prime, it is not a divisor $(p-1)!$, but is a divisor of $a^{p-1}-1$  


#### 8.18
$gcd(a,b)\leq a$ since `a` is a common divisor $gcd(a,b) = a$  


#### 8.19
If $d=gcd(a,b)$ then $d\mid a$ and $d\mid b$ and also $d\mid b-a$. This means that $gcd(a,b) = d \leq gcd(a,b)$  


#### 8.20
a) $gcd(a/2, b)\mid (a/2)$ and $gcd(a/2, b)\mid a$. So $gcd(a/2, b)$ is a common divisor of `a` and `b` and hence $gcd(a/2, b) \leq gcd(a,b)$  
b) $gcd(a/2,b/2)\mid (a/2)$ and $2gcd(a/2, b/2) \mid a$. Similarly, $2gcd(a/2,b/2)\mid b$, and hence $2gcd(a/2,b/2)\leq gcd(a,b)$  


#### 8.21
Consider each prime that occurs in either one of them, raise it to the larger of the two exponents, and multiply these  


#### 8.22
If `a` and `b` are the two numbers. Take the prime factors of `a` one by one, divide `b` with them repeatedly to determine their exponent in the prime factorization of `b`, raise them to the smaller of their exponent and multiply them  


#### 8.23
Each prime occurs the same number of times in the prime factorization of both sides  


#### 8.24
$gcd(a+1, a) = gcd(1,a) = 1$  


#### 8.25
$gcd(F_{n+1}, F_n) = gcd(F_n, F_{n-1}) = \dots = gcd(F_3, F_2) = 1$ executed $n-1$ times
