## 8. Integers, divisors and primes

#### Notes
- $a|b$ = `b` is a multiple of `a` or `a` divides `b`  

#### 8.1
$a = a \cdot 1 = (-a) \cdot (-1)$  


#### 8.2
a) `a` is even  
b) `a` is odd  
c) `a` is 0  


#### 8.3
a) If $b= a \cdot m$ and $c = a\cdot n$ then $c = a\cdot m \cdot n$  
b) If $b= a \cdot m$ and $c = a \cdot n$ then $b+c=a(m+n)$ and $b-c = a(m-n)$  
c) If $b= a \cdot m$ and $a, b > 0$ then $m>0$, hence $m \geq 1$ and so $b \geq a$  
d) If $b= a \cdot m$ and $a = b \cdot n$ then $a = a \cdot m$, so $m \cdot n = 1$. This means that either $m = n = 1$ or $m = n = -1$  


#### 8.4
We have $a=c \cdot n$ and $b=c \cdot m$ thus $r = b - aq = c(m-nq)$  


#### 8.5
The same as the remainder of the division $c:a$  


#### 8.6
a) $a^2-1=(a-1)(a+1)$  
b) $a^n-1 = (a-1)(a^{n-1}+\dots +a+1)$  


#### 8.7
Yes, `2` is a prime number  


#### 8.8
a) `p` occurs in the prime factorization of `ab`, it must also occur in the prime factorization of `a` or `b`  
b) $p|a(b/a)$, but $p\nmid a$. We must have $p\mid (b/a)$  


#### 8.9
If $n=p_1 p_2 \dots p_k$, each $p_i \geq 2$, $n\geq 2^k$  


#### 8.10
If $r_i = r_j$ then $ia-ja$ is divisible by `p`. But $ia-ja=(i-j)a$ and `a` or $i-j$ are divisible by `p`. This means that $r_i$ are all different  


#### 8.11
If `n` is composite but not a square, then there is a prime `P` that occurs in the prime factorization of `n` an odd number of times  


#### 8.12
There's a prime that ocurrs in the prime factorization of $n$, $t$ times and $k\nmid t$. If $\sqrt[k]{n} = a/b$ then $nb^k = a^k$. If $\sqrt[k]{n}$ is not an integer then it's irrational
