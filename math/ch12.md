## 12. Matchings in graphs

#### Notes
- Bipartite Graph: if the nodes of a graph can be partitioned into two classes, say `A` and `B` so that every edge connects a node in `A` to a node in `B`  
- Perfect Matching: A set of edges such that every node is incident with exactly one of them  
- Hamiltonian Cycle: A cycle in a graph that contains all of the nodes of the graph  


#### 12.1
If every degree is `d`, then the number of edges is $d \cdot | A | $, but also $d \cdot | B |$  


#### 12.2
a) A triangle  
b) A star  


#### 12.3
A graph in which every node has degree 2 is the union of disjoint cycles. If the graph is bipartite, these cycles have even length  


#### 12.4
Let $X \subseteq A$ and let $Y$ denote the set of neighbors of $X$ in $B$. There are exactly $d | X |$ edges starting from $X$. Every node in $Y$ accomodates no more than $d$ of these, this means that $| Y | \geq | X |$  


#### 12.5
On a path with 4 nodes, we may select the middle edge  


#### 12.6
The edges in $M$ must meet every edge in $G$. Every edge in the perfect matching has at most one endpoint unmatched by $M$  


#### 12.7
The largest matching has 5 edges  


#### 12.8
If the algorithm terminates with no perfect matching, then the set $S$ shows that the graph is not "good"  


#### 12.9
The first graph has a Hamiltonian Cycle. The second graph does not contain a Hamiltonian Cycle
