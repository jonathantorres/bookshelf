## 13. Graph Coloring


#### 13.1
If $n>1$, assume the description of the coloring is valid for the first $n-1$ circles. If we add the $n-th$, the color and the parity don't change this circle, both change inside the circle  


#### 13.2
a) By induction, if we add a line, we recolor all regions on one side  
b) If `p` is any point not on any of the lines. Start a semiline from `p`. Count how many of the given lines intersect it. Color it accoring to the parity of this intersection number
