## Combinatorial Probability

#### 7.1
The union of two events corresponds to the subsets "A or B"


#### 7.2
It's the sum of probabilities of outcomes, when we add them all, we get 1


#### 7.3
$P(E) = \frac{1}{2}$  
$P(T) = \frac{1}{3}$  


#### 7.4
The same probabilities are added on both sides


#### 7.5
Every probability with $S\in A\cap B$ is added twice, every probability with $S\in A\cupB but S\notin A\capB$ is added once


#### 7.6
$(E,T), (O,T), (L,T)$ are independent  
$(E,O) is exclusive$  


#### 7.7
$P(\emptyset \cap A) = P(\emptyset) = 0 = P(\emptyset)P(A)$


#### 7.8
$P(A) = \frac{|S|^{n-1}}{|S|^n} = \frac{1}{|S|}$  
$P(B) = \frac{|S|^{n-1}}{|S|^n} = \frac{1}{|S|}$  
$P(A\cap B) = \frac{|S|^{n-2}}{|S|^n} = \frac{1}{|S|^2} = P(A)P(B)$
