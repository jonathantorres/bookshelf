## 11. Finding the optimum

#### 11.1
If `H` is an optimal tree and `G` is a tree constructed by the pessimistic government. When an edge $e=uv$ of `H` is eliminated, we get two components since `G` is connected it has an edge `f` connecting them. The edge `f` cannot be more expensive than `e` otherwise the government would have eliminated it. Therefore we can replace `e` by `f` in `H` without increasing its cost  


#### 11.2
Same as 11.1  


#### 11.3
Same as 11.1  


#### 11.4
If we have nodes $1,2,3,4$ and the costs $c(12) = c(23) = c(34) = c(41) = 3, c(13) = 4, c(24) = 1$. The pessimistic government builds $(1,2,3,4,1)$ while the cheapest solution is $(1,2,4,3,1)$  


#### 11.5
No, since it intersects itself  


#### 11.6
If you replace two intersecting edges by two other edges pairing the same 4 nodes, it will give you a shorter tour by the triangle inequality
