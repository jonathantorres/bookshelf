## 9. Graphs

#### Notes
- Degree: Number of edges leaving the node of a graph  
- Connected Graph: A graph `G` is connected if every two nodes of the graph can be connected by a path in `G`  
- Connected Component: If `G` is a graph that is not necessarily connected. A connected component `H` is a maximal subgraph that is connected  

#### 9.1
2 graphs with 2 nodes. 8 graphs with 3 nodes. 16 graphs with 4 nodes.  


#### 9.2
a) No, sum of degrees must be even  
b) No, node with degree 5, must connect to every node  
c) There are 12 graphs  
d) $9 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 = 945$  


#### 9.3
If there are 4 people at the party, then it has 6 edges or $\binom{4}{2}$

|              | Graph A | Graph B |
| -----------  | ------- | ------- |
| Degree of 1  | 9       | 9       |
| Degree of 2  | 5       | 5       |
| Degree of 3  | 3       | 7       |
| Degree of 4  | 3       | 5       |
| Degree of 5  | 2       | 8       |
| Degree of 6  | 3       | 3       |
| Degree of 7  | 1       | 9       |
| Degree of 8  | 3       | 5       |
| Degree of 9  | 2       | 7       |
| Degree of 10 | 3       | 4       |


#### 9.6
45 edges or $\binom{10}{2}$  


#### 9.7
$2(\binom{20}{2}) = 2^{190}$  


#### 9.8
Every graph has 2 nodes with the same degree  


#### 9.9
There are 8 graphs  


#### 9.10
$2^n$ subgraphs  
$8$ subgraphs  


#### 9.11
a) Yes, the proof is valid  
b) Yes, the proof is valid  


#### 9.12
a) If the deleted edge contains the nodes `a` and `b`, then there is not a path that goes through `a` and `b`  
b) If any node `a` and `b`, if the path between these goes through `e`, there will be a longer path through a different edge  


#### 9.13
a) A walk from `u` to `v`, if it goes through a node more than once, this node can be deleted, and there will still be a path from `u` to `v`  
b) The two paths together form a walk from `a` to `c`  


#### 9.14
If `a` is a node in common between $H$ and $H_2$, the path between `u` and `v`, can also be take through `u` and `w`, following a path from `w` to `v` we can walk $H$ from `u` to `w`  


#### 9.15
Both graphs are connected  


#### 9.16
The union of that edge and one of these components would form a connected graph that is larger than the component  


#### 9.17
If there is a path `P` in `G` connecting `u` and `v` then this path is a connected subgraph, and a connected subgraph that contains `P` is a connected component containing `u` and `v`  


#### 9.18
$\binom{k}{2} + \binom{n-k}{2} = \binom{n-1}{2} - \frac{(k-1)(n-k-1)}{2}\leq \binom{n-1}{2}$
