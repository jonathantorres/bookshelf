# 41. Locality and the Fast File System

1. Distributed accross all nodes

2. With this setting, it's distributed on just 2 nodes

3. The filespan is a lot less with larger values

4. It's distributed accross the groups in alphabetical order

5. I think it does a pretty good job, the numbers are low and distributed evenly

6. It changed significantly, the dirspan numbers are way too high

7. It does affect dirspan I would think, the numbers are high

8. File /i has a much bigger size

9. Layout does not change as much, same as the filespan and dirspan
