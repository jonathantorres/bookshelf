# 29. Lock-based Concurrent Data Structures (Answers)

1. I'd say it's accurate, the smallest unit that it can measure is microseconds. See `gettime.c`

2. CPU with 2 cores. I'm guessing it does, see `simple_counter.c`

3. Closely, see `slop_counter.c`

4. The hand-over-hand list works better when a lot of operations are needed on the list, see `list.c`

5. See a multithreaded tree in `tree.c`

6. Multithreaded tree in `tree.c`
