## The Abstraction: The Process (Answers)
1. I think it would be 100%, due to the parameters passed to the program

2. It takes a total time of 10

3. I thought it would be the same but the cpu process continues executing while the io process waits

4. The cpu process waits for the io to finish before continuing

5. Both the cpu and io processes run and finish at the same time

6. No, I do not think so, since the io process wait for all the cpu process to finish and the cpu processes are executed one after the other, which makes them run longer

7. The first process runs immediately and the io runs once this process finishes. It runs faster than the previous one, even tho the cpu processes still execute one after the other

8. SWITCH_ON_END makes the processes run longer, withouth it both the cpu and the io process will finish at the same time
