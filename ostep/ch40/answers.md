# 40. File System Implementation

1. Possible operations are, creat(), link(), unlink(), open() and mkdir(). Figure out the operations depending on the run

2. It prefers to allocate the more important bits first

3. It would be impossible to create directories or any files at all under such constraints

4. Same as before, but with inodes, can't create directories or files without them
