### Exercise 9.10
An application makes several allocation and free requests to the first size class, and then the second size class, and then the third size class and so on and so forth.

For each size class the allocator would create a lot of memory that would not be reclaimed since the allocator does not coalesce, and the application does not make further requests from those classes in the future.
