### Exercise 3.45

- A: a = 0, b = 8, c = 16, d = 24, e = 28, f = 32, g = 40, h = 48
- B: 56 bytes
- C: a = 0, c = 8, g = 16, e = 24, h = 28, b = 32, d = 34, f = 35. Total size of 40 bytes and struct displayed below:
```c
    struct {
        char *a;
        double c;
        long g;
        float e;
        int h;
        short b;
        char d;
        char f;
    } rec;
```
