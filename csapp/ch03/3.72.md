### Exercise 3.72
- A: When n is odd, then `s2 = s1 - (n * 8 + 24)`. When n is even, then `s2 = s1 - (n * 8 + 16)`
- B: `p = (s2 + 15) & 0xFFFFFFF0`
- C: If n is even then `s1 = n % 16 == 1` which makes the min of `e1 = 1`. If n is odd, then `s1 = n % 16 == 0`, which makes the max of `e1 = 24`
- D: 16 byte alignment
