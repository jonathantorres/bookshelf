### Exercise 2.26
- A. It will produce an incorrect result when `s` is shorter than `t`
- B. Since `size_t` is unsigned, it can't produce a negative value, so it will produce a very large number, which is obviously larger than 0
- C. I would re-write it like so:
```c
int strlonger(char *s, char *t) {
    return strlen(s) > strlen(t);
}
```
