### Exercise 2.25
- The memory error happens since we are substracting 1 from 0 on an unsigned integer. At the bit level, this operation will result in `0xFFFFFFFF` which is a little over 4 billion, and will cause the condition of the loop to continue executing, and probably accessing invalid memory through the array `a[i]`.
- The way to fix this is to make the `length` variable a signed integer, since the substraction will return the value -1 and this is clearly less than 0. This would fail the condition of the loop and not execute it.
