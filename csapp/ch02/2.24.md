Two's Complement  
| Original  | Truncated    |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 0         | 0            |
| 2         | 2            |
| -7        | 1            |
| -5        | 3            |
| -1        | -1           |

For each case, equation 2.9 is applied as `x mod 2^k`. If `x = 15` and it's unsigned, when truncated we get: `15 mod 2^3 = 15 mod 8 = 7`  

For each case, equation 2.10 is applied as `x mod 2^k`. If `x = -5` and it's signed, when truncated we get: `11 mod 2^3 = 11 mod 8 = 3 = U2T(3) = 3`
