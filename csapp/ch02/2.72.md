### Exercise 2.72
- A: `sizeof` returns an unsigned number, and thus `maxbytes` is also cast to unsigned. If `maxbytes` is less than the result of `sizeof` then the result would not be represented as a negative value
- B: The conditional test can be rewritten as `if ((int) (maxbytes-sizeof(val)) >= 0)`
