### Exercise 12.10
If the implementation of semaphores is based on a stack of threads. When a thread blocks on a semaphore in a `P` operation, it's ID is pushed into the stack. In a `V` operation the stack pops the thread ID from the top of the stack and restarts that thread.

With this implementation, a writer in it's critical section could wait until another writer blocks on the semaphore before releasing the semaphore. In this scenario a waiting reader could wait forever as two writers are passing control to the critical section back and forth.
