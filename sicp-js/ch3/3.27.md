### Exercise 3.27
It reduces the running time to `O(n)` at the expense of more memory since we are mantaining a table that stores results that have already been calculated previously, this would prevent the tree of recursion from growing exponentially.

Defining `memo_fib` as `memoize(fib)` would not work since `fib` calls itself recursively and on each recursive call to `fib` the table lookup won't be done, the same calculation (recursive call) will be done instead. The only call that will be stored in the table, would be the first call to `fib`, which will be reused on other calls in the tree of recursion, but it won't speed up the calculation significantly.
