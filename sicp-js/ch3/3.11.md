### Exercise 3.11
- In this diagram, the local state for `acc` is kept in environment "E1"
- When `acc2` is created, it's state is kept in a separate environment, let's call it "E6", with it's own definitions of `withdraw`, `deposit`, `dispatch` etc. etc. (the code might be shared)
- The local states of both accounts are kept separate on their own environment
- The global environment is shared and also possibly the code for the functions
