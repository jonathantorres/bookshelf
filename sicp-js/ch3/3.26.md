### Exercise 3.26
The table should be organized as a binary tree (or sometimes called binary tree map). When looking up a key, we use a comparison function (like equal) and do a binary search on the tree. This would make lookups run pretty fast in `O(log n)` time.

The insertions can be more tricky, they can unbalance the tree easily if we don't use a more sophisticated way of doing them. These can be achieved by using a specialized binary tree called AVL Tree or a Red Black Tree. Which will keep the tree balanced on insertions.
