### Exercise 2.16
This is the dependency problem in interval arithmetic. I think is not possible to devise an interval-arithmetic package without this shortcoming. One possible way to address this is to introduce a concept of identity on the intervals and reduce/simplify the expressions as much as possible before they are calculated. This would require some serious math skills.
