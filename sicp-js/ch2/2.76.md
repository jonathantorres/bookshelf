### Exercise 2.76
- Explicit Dispatch: Add a new clause in the constructor on each type for the new operation
- Data Directed: Add a new entry on the table of general operations
- Message Passing: Add a new clause with the new operation on the dispatch function for the constructor

If a new type is going to be added often, the Data Directed approach should be more appropriate. Message Passing should be more appropriate if new operations are added often.
