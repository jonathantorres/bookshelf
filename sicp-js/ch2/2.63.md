### Exercise 2.63

a. Yes, it will always return a list in sorted order. Both functions return the same list `list(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)` on all of the trees illustrated.  
b. No, `tree_to_list_1` executes in `O(n log n)` due to the call to the `append` function and `tree_to_list_2` executes in `O(n)` since `pair` is a constant time function.
