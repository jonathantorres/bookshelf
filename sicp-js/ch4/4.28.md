### Exercise 4.28
- Every expression is evaluated using `evaluate`, and `display` is a primitive function so it will call `force_it` to get the parameter passed to `display`
- In the original `eval_sequence`, the values are `pair(1,2)` and `1`. In Cy's proposed change, the values are `pair(1,2)` and `pair(1,2)`
- `tail(items)` is passed as `actual_value` and not `evaluate`, it does not matter since they are forced anyways
- I would go with Cy's approach
