### Exercise 4.67
Rules from 4.61:
```
rule(father($s, $f), or(son($f, $s), and(son($w, $s), wife($f, $w))))
rule(grandson($g, $s), and(father($s, $f), father($f, $g)))
```

New rules:
```
rule(son($f, $s), and(wife($f, $m), son($m, $s)))
rule(grandson($gf, $s), and(son($gf, $f), son($f, $s)))
rule(ends_with_grandson(grandson()))
rule(ends_with_grandson(pair($x, $rest)), ends_with_grandson($rest))
rule(grandson()($gf, gs), grandson($gf, $gs))
rule(related(pair($g, $rel), $a, $d),
    and(ends_with_grandson($rel), son($a, $as), related($as, $d))
)
```
