### Exercise 4.62
At first, the query system will give the answer `outranked_by(list("Bitdiddle", "Ben"), list("Warbucks", "Oliver"))`

This is returned because it matches an existing assertion. Then the system will match `outranked_by($middle_manager, $boss)` which applies the same rule again. This match gets all supervisor assertions, which then will try to match `outranked_by($staff_person, $boss)` and enter an infinite loop.
