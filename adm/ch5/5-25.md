*5.25 - An arborescence of a directed graph `G` is a rooted tree such that there is a directed path from the root to every other vertex in the graph. Give an efficient and correct algorithm to test whether `G` contains an arborescence, and its time complexity.*  
***
Loop through every vertex on the graph, on each iteration, do a BFS starting from that vertex. Once the BFS is done for that vertex, scan every other vertex and if they all of them are discovered, then break out of this loop and report this current vertex as the rooted tree. This would run on $O(n^2)$. Pseudocode:
```
function arborescence(G)
    root_vertex = nil
    for every vertex in G
        BFS(v)
        found_undiscovered = false
        for every vertex in G (not including v)
            if v is undiscovered
                found_undiscovered = true

        if found_undiscovered == false
            root_vertex = v

    if root_vertex == nil
        return false
    else
        return true
```
