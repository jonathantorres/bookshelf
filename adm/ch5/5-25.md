*5.25 - An arborescence of a directed graph G is a rooted tree such that there is a directed path from the root to every other vertex in the graph. Give an efficient and correct algorithm to test whether G contains an arborescence, and its time complexity.*  
***
Use BFS to keep track of the root, to every other vertex of the graph. To check if there's indeed a path from the root to every vertex in the graph. This would run on `O(n+m)` time
