*5.6 - In breadth-first and depth-first search, an undiscovered node is marked discovered when it is first encountered, and marked processed when it has been completely searched. At any given moment, several nodes might be simultaneously in the discovered state.*  
*(a) Describe a graph on `n` vertices and a particular starting vertex `v` such that `Θ(n)` nodes are simultaneously in the discovered state during a breadth-first search starting from `v`.  
(b) Describe a graph on `n` vertices and a particular starting vertex `v` such that `Θ(n)` nodes are simultaneously in the discovered state during a depth-first search starting from `v`.  
(c) Describe a graph on `n` vertices and a particular starting vertex `v` such that at some point `Θ(n)`nodes remain undiscovered, while `Θ(n)` nodes have been processed during a depth-first search starting from `v`. (Note, there may also be discovered nodes.)*
***
- A graph with a starting vertex `v` with `n-1` edges coming out of it.
- A graph with a starting vertex `v` with `n-1` edges and nodes after it in a single line. `v->y->z`.
- A graph starting at vertex `v`, going half way through the search for `n/2` nodes that are discovered, there can be `n/2` nodes that are undiscovered.
