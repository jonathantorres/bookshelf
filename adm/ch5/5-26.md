*5.26 - A mother vertex in a directed graph `G=(V, E)` is a vertex `v` such that all other vertices `G` can be reached by a directed path from `v`.*  
*- Give an `O(n+m)` algorithm to test whether a given vertex `v` is a mother of `G`, where `n=|V|` and `m=|E|`*  
*- Give an `O(n+m)` algorithm to test whether graph `G` contains a mother vertex.*  
***
a. Do a BFS starting on `v` and test whether `v` has `n-1` tree nodes rooted from `v`. You can also loop through the adjacency list of `v` and check if every other vextex in `G` is in it.  

b. Do the same as above (but the second option using the adjacency list) but do it for every vertex in the graph. The vertex that has every other vertex in it's adjacency list, would be the mother vertex. I think it's possible to be more than one.
