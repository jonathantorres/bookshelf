*5.5 - Give a linear algorithm to compute the chromatic number of graphs where each vertex has degree at most 2. Must such graphs be bipartite?*
***
Graphs with a max degree 2 can be bipartite (even number of edges) or tripartite (odd number of edges). Consider a triangle (3 edges, 3 vertices). It's not bipartite even though every node has an even number of edges and the graph has an even number of edges.
