*5.7 - Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, is it possible to reconstruct the tree? If so, sketch an algorithm to do it. If not, give a counter example. Repeat the problem if you are given the pre-order and post-order traversals.*
***

Yes, it's possible. Using the given pre-order and in-order traversals:  
```
function reconstruct_tree(t) {
    new_tree = init_tree()
    pre_order(t, new_tree)
    return new_tree
}

function pre_order(t, new_tree) {
    add_item_to_tree(new_tree, t->value)
    pre_order(t->left, new_tree)
    pre_order(t->right, new_tree)
}
```

Yes, it's also possible with pre-order and post-order traversals by using the same pre-order algorithm. The tree will be the same and have the same structure.
