*5.23 - Your job is to arrange `n` ill-behaved children in a straight line, facing front. You are given a list of `m` statements of the form "`i` hates `j`". If `i` hates `j`, then you do not want to put `i` somewhere behind `j`, because then `i` is capable of throwing something at `j`.*  
*- Give an algorithm that orders the line, (or says that it is not possible) in `O(m+n)` time.*  
*- Suppose instead you want to arrange the children in rows such that if `i` hates `j`,then `i` must be in a lower numbered row than `j`. Give an efficient algorithm to find the minimum number of rows needed, if it is possible.*
***
- Create a directed graph with vertices representing the children and the edges representing "`i` hates `j`" relations and use topological sorting
- Build a BFS graph from the directed graph from the previous answer. The maximum depth of this graph is the number of rows necessary
