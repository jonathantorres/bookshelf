*5.21 - Let `v` and `w` be two vertices in a directed graph `G=(V, E)`. Design a linear-time algorithm to find the number of different shortest paths (not necessarily vertex disjoint) between `v` and `w`. Note: the edges in `G` are unweighted.*
***
Use BFS from vertex `v`. For every node keep track of the level from the vertext `v`. When `w` is encountered for the first time the level of `w` is the length of the shortest path. Count how many times you discover `w` on that level. Stop expanding nodes when you go past the length of the shortest path.
