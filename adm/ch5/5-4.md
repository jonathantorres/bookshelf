*5.4 - Prove that in a breadth-first search on a undirected graph `G`, every edge is either a tree edge or a cross edge, where `x` is neither an ancestor nor descendant of `y`, in cross edge `(x, y)`.*
***
Since the graph is undirected, the direction of each edge can go either way, so each edge can be a tree edge or cross edge.
