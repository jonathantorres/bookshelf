*5.22 - Design a linear-time algorithm to eliminate each vertex `v` of degree 2 from a graph by replacing edges `(u, v)` and `(v, w)` by an edge `(u, w)`. We also seek to eliminate multiple copies of edges by replacing them with a single edge. Note that removing multiple copies of an edge may create a new vertex of degree 2, which has to be removed, and that removing a vertex of degree 2 may create multiple edges, which also must be removed.*
***
Do a BFS on the graph and evaluate each vertex and check it's degree. Since on each pass through a vertex, we also evaluate it's neighbors, do the neccesary replacements on that point. A recursive algorithm would be the most intuitive choice.
