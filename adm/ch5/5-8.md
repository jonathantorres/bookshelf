*5.8 - Present correct and efficient algorithms to convert an undirected graph `G` between the following graph data structures. You must give the time complexity of each algorithm, assuming `n` vertices and `m` edges.*  
*- Convert from an adjacency matrix to adjacency lists.*  
*- Convert from an adjacency list to an incidence matrix. An incidence matrix `M` has a row for each vertex and a column for each edge, such that `M[i,j]=1` if vertex `i` is part of edge `j`, otherwise `M[i,j]=0`.*  
*- Convert from an incidence matrix to adjacency lists.*  
***
- Loop through each row/column in the matrix and if the current value of the matrix is true, create the proper linked list for the current index, if a list is already there, just add the new entry to it. `O(n x m)`
- Loop through each key/list, and if a list is there, loop through it and add it to the matrix, keeping a key index on each iteration of the list, to use those indices when creating the incidence matrix. This should run on `O(n+m)`
- Same as the previous answers but creating a list for the key, if the current row/column is true, for the existence of the edge. This should run on `O(n+m)`
