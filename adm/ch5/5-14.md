*5.14 - A vertex cover of a graph `G=(V, E)` is a subset of vertices `V′ ∈ V` such that every edge in `E` contains at least one vertex from `V′`. Delete all the leaves from any depth-first search tree of `G`. Must the remaining vertices form a vertex cover of `G`? Give a proof or a counterexample.*  
***
Yes, as long as the graph `G` is connected and we do not include the root as part of the final result. Given the graph displayed below, in which the vertex cover are the vertices 4 and 5 and it's DFS tree. If we remove all the leaf nodes, the nodes that are left are the node labeled 4 and 5 (not including the root)
