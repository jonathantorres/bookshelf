*5.14 - A vertex cover of a graph `G=(V, E)` is a subset of vertices `V′ ∈ V` such that every edge in `E` contains at least one vertex from `V′`. Delete all the leaves from any depth-first search tree of `G`. Must the remaining vertices form a vertex cover of `G`? Give a proof or a counterexample.*  
***
I think it would depend on the resulted tree, if all leaves are deleted, the remaining vertices may no longer form the vertex cover.
