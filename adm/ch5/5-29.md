*5.29 - Following up on the previous problem, give an `O(n+m)` algorithm that finds a deletion order for the `n` vertices such that no deletion disconnects the graph. (Hint: think DFS/BFS)*  
***
- This would be similar to 5-28
- We traverse the graph with DFS or BFS and once we construct the tree, we should delete just the leaf nodes of the tree
- I think they can be deleted in any order, as long as they are leaf nodes, it shouldn't disconnect the graph
