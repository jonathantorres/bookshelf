*5.10 - Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a DAG (directed acyclic graph) with common subexpressions removed. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of the standard arithmetical operations `(+,−,∗,/)`. For example, the expression `2 + 3∗4+(3∗4)/5` is represented by the DAG below. Give an `O(n+m)` algorithm for evaluating such a DAG, where there are `n` nodes and `m` edges in the DAG. Hint: modify an algorithm for the tree case to achieve the desired efficiency*

***
If the expression is evaluated from left to right and doing the expressions that are on parenthesis first. This can be done with depth-first search. When processing each node, treat the leafs as a literal, and anything else as an arithmetic expression. DFS will process the multiplications first, followed by the divisions and doing the additions at the end.
