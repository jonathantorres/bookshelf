*5.9 - Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of the standard arithmetical operations `(+,−,∗,/)`. For example, the expression `2 + 3∗4+(3∗4)/5` is represented by the tree below (a). Give an `O(n)` algorithm for evaluating such an expression, where there are `n` nodes in the tree.*

***
If the expression is evaluated from left to right and doing the expression that are on parenthesis first. This can be done with depth-first search. When processing each node, treat the leafs as a literal, and anything else as an arithmetic expression. DFS will process the multiplications first, followed by the divisions and doing the additions at the end.
