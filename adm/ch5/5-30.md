*5.30 - Suppose `G` is a connected undirected graph. An edge `e` whose removal disconnects the graph is called a bridge. Must every bridge `e` be an edge in a depth-first search tree of `G`? Give a proof or a counterexample.*  
***
- Yes, every bridge should be an edge, since that edge is a bridge node that will disconnect the graph.
