## Chapter 5 - Notes
- Graphs can be used to model a wide variety of structures and relationships. Graph-theoretic terminology gives us a language to talk about them.
- Adjacency lists are the right data structure for most applications of graphs.
- Breadth-first search and depth-first searches provide mechanisms to visit each edge and vertex of the graph. They prove the basis of most simple, efficient graph algorithms.
- DFS organizes vertices by entry/exit times, and edges into tree and back edges. This organization is what gives DFS it's real power.
- It is more important to understand different algorithmic graph problems rather than understanding the details of particular graph structures.
- Understand what problems are actually graph problems.
