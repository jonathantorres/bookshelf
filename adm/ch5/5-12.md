*5.12 - The square of a directed graph `G=(V, E)` is the graph `G^2=(V, E2)` such that `(u, w) ∈ E^2` iff there exists `v ∈ V` such that `(u, v) ∈ E` and `(v, w) ∈ E` i.e, there is a path of exactly two edges from `u` to `w`.Give efficient algorithms for both adjacency lists and matrices.*

We're basically adding more edges for vertices that have a path of two edges. These can be added by doing a BFS from each vertex, and add the edges for each in `O(n(V+E))`. The adjacency matrix would probably have the worst performance.
