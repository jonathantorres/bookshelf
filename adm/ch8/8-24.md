*8.24 - Given a set of coin denominators, find the minimum number of coins to make a certain amount of change.*
***
- For example 12, the greedy algorithm will pick up 10, 1, 1 while the shortest possible can be 6, 6
- Instead of using a greedy algorithm, calculate every possible combination of coins to the value `n` using a dynamic programming table. This way we don't compute the same values more than once. Running time of `O(nk)`. `n` being the number of coins and `k` the different denominations of coins.
