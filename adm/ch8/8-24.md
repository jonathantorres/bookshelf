*8.24 - Given a set of coin denominators, find the minimum number of coins to make a certain amount of change.*
***
- For example 12, the greedy algorithm will pick up 10, 1, 1 while the shortest possible can be 6, 6
- Solution using Dynamic Programming:
- Subproblem: $DP(n,k) =$ minimum number of coins to make change for `n-1` using $d_1\dots d_{k-1}$ denominations
- Recurrence: $DP(n,k) = min(DP(n-1,k-1)-1)$
- Running time of $O(nk)$. `n` being the number of coins and `k` the different denominations of coins.
