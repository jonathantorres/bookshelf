*8.18 - Consider the problem of storing `n` books on shelves in a library. The order of the books is fixed by the cataloging system and so cannot be rearranged. Therefore, we can speak of a book `b[i]`,where `1≤i≤n`, that has a thickness `t[i]` and height `h[i]`. The length of each bookshelf at this library is `L`.*

*Suppose all the books have the same heighth (`h=h[i]=h[j]` for all `i`, `j`) and the shelves are all separated by a distance of greater than `h`, so any book fits on any shelf. The greedy algorithm would fill the first shelf with as many books as we can until we get the smallest `i` such that `b[i]` does not fit, and then repeat with subsequent shelves. Show that the greedy algorithm always finds the optimal shelf placement, and analyze its time complexity.*
***
We need to put as much books as possible in the shelves, as the greedy algorithm would do. Therefore the greedy algorithm will always find the optimal shelf placement. It seems as if the algorithm would run in $O(n)$ time
