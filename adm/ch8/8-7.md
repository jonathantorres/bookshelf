*8.7 - In the United States, coins are minted with denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents. Now consider a country whose coins are minted with denominations of `{d1,...,dk}` units. We want to count how many distinct ways `C(n)` there are to make change of `n` units. For example, in a country whose denominations are `{1,6,10}`, `C(5) = 1`, `C(6)` to `C(9) = 2`, `C(10) = 3`, and `C(12) = 4`.*
- *How many ways are there to make change of 20 units from `{1,6,10}`?*
- *Give an efficient algorithm to compute `C(n)`, and analyze its complexity. (Hint: think in terms of computing `C(n,d)`, the number of ways to make change of `n` units with highest denomination `d`. Be careful to avoid overcounting.).*

- Six times - `C(20) = 6`, see the following table:

|   |
| - |
| 10,10 |
| 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 |
| 6,6,6,1,1 |
| 10,6,1,1,1,1 |
| 10,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 |
| 6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 |

- The number of ways to make a sum $S$ from a set $D={a,b,\dots m,n}$ where $D[i] < D[j]$ for `i<j` is the sum of the ways to make $S$, $S-n,\dots S-xn$ from $D={a,b,c,\dots m}$
