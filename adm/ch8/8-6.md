*8.6 - Coins in the United States are minted with denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents. Now consider a country whose coins are minted with denominations of `{d1,...,dk}` units. We seek an algorithm to make change of `n` units using the minimum number of coins for this country.*
- *The greedy algorithm repeatedly selects the biggest coin no bigger than the amount to be changed and repeats until it is zero. Show that the greedy algorithm does not always use the minimum number of coins in a country whose denominations are `{1,6,10}`.*
- *Give an efficient algorithm that correctly determines the minimum number of coins needed to make change of `n` units using denominations `{d1,...,dk}`. Analyze its running time.*
***
- For example 12, the greedy algorithm will pick up 10, 1, 1 while the shortest possible can be 6, 6
- Instead of using a greedy algorithm, calculate every possible combination of coins to the value `n` using a dynamic programming table. This way we don't compute the same values more than once. Running time of `O(nk)`. `n` being the number of coins and `k` the different denominations of coins.
