*8.16 - Consider a city whose streets are defined by an `X×Y` grid. We are interested in walking from the upper left-hand corner of the grid to the lower right-hand corner. Unfortunately, the city has bad neighborhoods, whose intersections we do not wantto walk in. We are given an `X×Y` matrix `BAD`, where `BAD[i,j] = “yes”` if and only if the intersection between streets `i` and `j` is in a neighborhood to avoid.*
- *Give an example of the contents of `BAD` such that there is no path across the grid avoiding bad neighborhoods*
- *Give an `O(XY)` algorithm to find a path across the grid that avoids bad neighborhoods.*
- *Give an `O(XY)` algorithm to find the shortest path across the grid that avoids bad neighborhoods. You may assume that all blocks are of equal length. For partial credit, give an `O(X^2Y^2)` algorithm.*
***
- `B` means `BAD`, `G` means good

- Implement a basic breadth first search algorithm that visits each block just once. Start at the top left corner and put each block in a queue. If we visit the lower right corner then we found the path.
- Can be done with a similar BFS as with the previous answer. Set a good block to zero and add one to a bad block. Once finished, we'll end up with a cost matrix that will help us find the shortest path.
