*8.11 - Assume that there are `n` numbers (some possibly negative) on a circle, and we wish to find the maximum contiguous sum along an arc of the circle. Give an efficient algorithm for solving this problem*
***
For each length of range `l` in `1...n` for each starting index `i` calculate the sum of the range of length `l`, starting at `i` as the sum of the range of length `l-1` starting at `i` plus the integer at `i+1 mod n`
