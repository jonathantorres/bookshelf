*8.1 - Typists often make transposition errors exchanging neighboring characters, such as typing "setve" when you mean "steve." This requires two substitutions to fix under the conventional definition of edit distance.*

*Incorporate a swap operation into our edit distance function, so that such neighboring transposition errors can be fixed at the cost of one operation.*
***
It's the regular editing dynamic programming, except that the diagonal as an extra possibility when a swap is possible `M[i,j] = M[i-2, j-2] + 1` if `A[i] == B[j-1]` and `A[i-1] == B[j]` where `i,j > 1`
