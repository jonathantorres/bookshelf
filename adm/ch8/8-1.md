*8.1 - Typists often make transposition errors exchanging neighboring characters, such as typing "setve" when you mean "steve." This requires two substitutions to fix under the conventional definition of edit distance.*

*Incorporate a swap operation into our edit distance function, so that such neighboring transposition errors can be fixed at the cost of one operation.*
***
- This would require an extra swap operation for this specific case
- This would apply on our dynamic programming table when: 
```
M[i,j] = M[i-2, j-2] + 1
if A[i] == B[j-1] and A[i-1] == B[j] where i,j > 1
```
