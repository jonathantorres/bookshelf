*8.20 - We wish to compute the laziest way to dial given `n` digit number on a standard push-button telephone using two fingers. We assume that the two fingers startout on the * and # keys, and that the effort required to move a finger from one button to another is proportional to the Euclidean distance between them. Design an algorithm that computes the method of dialing that involves moving your fingers the smallest amount of total distance, where `k` is the number of distinct keys on the keypad (`k=16` for standard telephones). Try to use `O(nk^3)` time.*
***
- Subproblem: $C(j,k,i)=$ the cheapest way to dial the first $i$ digits where $j$ is the left finger and $k$ the right finger
- Recurrence: $C(j,k,i)=min(C(j,k,i-1)+d(j,l,k,r))$
- Running Time: $O(nk^3)$
