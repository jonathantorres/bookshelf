*8.19 - This is a generalization of the previous problem. Now consider the case where the height of the books is not constant, but we have the freedom to adjust the height of each shelf to that of the tallest book on the shelf. Thus the cost of a particular layout is the sum of the heights of the largest book on each shelf.*
- *Give an example to show that the greedy algorithm of stuffing each shelf as full as possible does not always give the minimum overall height.*
- *Give an algorithm for this problem, and analyze its time complexity. Hint: use dynamic programming.*
***
- Subproblem: $C(i)=$ the shortest height shelving of book $B_1 \dots B_i$
- Recurrence: $C(i)=min(C(i-1)+max(h_k,h-j))$
- Running Time: $O(n^2)$
