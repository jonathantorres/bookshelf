*8.22 - Consider the problem of examining a string `x=x1x2...x[n]` from an alphabet of `k` symbols, and a multiplication table over this alphabet. Decide whether or not it is possible to parenthesize `x` in such a way that the value of the resulting expression is `a`, where `a` belongs to the alphabet. The multiplication table is neither commutative or associative, so the order of multiplication matters.*

*For example, consider the above multiplication table and the string `bbbba`. Parenthesizing it `(b(bb))(ba)` gives `a`, but `((((bb)b)b)a)` gives `c`.*

*Give an algorithm, with time polynomial in `n` and `k`, to decide whether such a parenthesization exists for a given string, multiplication table, and goal element.*
