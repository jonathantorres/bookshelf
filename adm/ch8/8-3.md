*8.3 - The longest common substring (not subsequence) of two strings `X` and `Y` is the longest string that appears as a run of consecutive letters in both strings. For example, the longest common substring of `photograph` and `tomography` is `ograph`.*
- *Let `n=|X|` and `m=|Y|`. Give a `Θ(nm)` dynamic programming algorithm for longest common substring based on the longest common subsequence/edit distance algorithm.*
- *Give a simpler `Θ(nm)` algorithm that does not rely on dynamic programming.*
***
- Loop through each letter on every string and compare each letter in place
- If the letters are the same, add the letter to an array `A` if not, clear the array, and continue to the next letter.
- Make sure to maintain another array of the consecutive substrings found, and return then longest one once the loop is finished.
