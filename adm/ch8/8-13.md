*8.13 - Consider the following data compression technique. We have a table of `m` text strings, each at most `k` in length. We want to encode a data string `D` of length `n` using as few text strings as possible. For example, if our table contains `(a,ba,abab,b)` and the data string is `bababbaababa`, the best way to encode it is `(b,abab,ba,abab,a)` a total of five code words. Give an `O(nmk)` algorithm to find the length of the best encoding. You may assume that every string has at least one encoding in terms of the table.*
***
- Subproblem: $E(m,n,k) =$ The best encoding for $D_1 \dots D_n$
- Recurrence: $E(m,n,k) = min(E(m-1,n-1,k)+E(m-1,n,k)+E(m,n-1,k))$
- Running Time: $O(mnk)$
