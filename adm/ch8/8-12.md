*8.12 - A certain string processing language allows the programmer to break a string into two pieces. It costs `n` units of time to break a string of `n` characters into two pieces, since this involves copying the old string. A programmer wants to break a string into many pieces, and the order in which the breaks are made can affect the total amount of time used. For example, suppose we wish to break a 20 character string after characters 3, 8, and 10. If the breaks are made in left-right order, then the first break costs 20 units of time, the second break costs 17 units of time, and the third break costs 12 units of time, for a total of 49 steps. If the breaks are made in right-left order, the first break costs 20 units of time, the second break costs 10 units of time, and the third break costs 8 units of time, for a total of only 38 steps.*

*Give a dynamic programming algorithm that takes a list of character positions after which to break and determines the cheapest break cost in `O(n^3)` time*
***
- Subproblem: $C(i,j) =$ The cheapest cost to cut up the string from $P_i \dots P_j$
- Recurrence: $C(i,j) = min(C(i,i+1)+C(i+1,j)+(P_j+P_i))$
- Running Time: $O(n^3)$
