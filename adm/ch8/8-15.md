*8.15 - Eggs break when dropped from great enough height. Specifically, there must be a floor `f` in any sufficiently tall building such that an egg dropped from the `fth` floor breaks, but one dropped from the `(f−1)st` floor will not. If the egg always breaks, then `f=1`. If the egg never breaks, then `f=n+1`.*

*You seek to find the critical floor `f` using an `n` story building. The only operation you can perform is to drop an egg off some floor and see what happens. You start out with `k` eggs, and seek to drop eggs as few times as possible. Broken eggs cannot be reused. Let `E(k, n)` be the minimum number of egg droppings that will always suffice.*

- *Show that `E(1,n)=n`.*
- *Show that `E(k,n) = Θ(n^1/k).*`*
- *Find a recurrence for `E(k,n)`. What is the running time of the dynamic program to find `E(k,n)`?*
***
- With only 1 egg, we have to find the `fth` floor and we start at the first and try each consecutive floor.
- Use a variation of binary search. Try the middle floor and continue halving to the ground or top floor depending on the result of the drop.
