*8.5 - Let `P[1],P[2],...,P[n]` be `n` programs to be stored on a disk with capacity `D` megabytes. Program `P[i]`requires `s[i]` megabytes of storage. We cannot store them all because `D < âˆ‘ni=1 s[i]`*
- *Does a greedy algorithm that selects programs in order of non decreasing `s[i]` maximize the number of programs held on the disk? Prove or give a counter example.*
- *Does a greedy algorithm that selects programs in order of non increasing order `s[i]` use as much of the capacity of the disk as possible? Prove or give a counter example.*
***
- Not neccesarily, since it picks all the programs with the bigger disk space first, so a very little amount of programs with a large size will be picked up first.
- Yes, since it will keep picking programs until the capacity is reached. So, the biggest program won't be selected.
