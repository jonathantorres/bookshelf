*8.2 - Suppose you are given three strings of characters: `X`,`Y`,and `Z`, where `|X|=n`, `|Y|=m`, and `|Z|=n+m`. `Z` is said to be a shuffle of `X` and `Y` iff `Z` can be formed by interleaving the characters from `X` and `Y` in a way that maintains the left-to-right ordering of the characters from each string.*
- *Show that `cchocohilaptesis` a shuffle of `chocolate` and `chips`, but `chocochilatspe` is not.*
- *Give an efficient dynamic-programming algorithm that determines whether `Z` is a shuffle of `X` and `Y`. Hint: the values of the dynamic programming matrix you construct should be Boolean, not numeric*
***
- If you try each letter in order, `chocolate` and `chips` merge in the right order to form `cchocohilaptesis`. In the case of `chocochilatspe` you take the last letter from `chocolate`, the next letter could be `s` or `t` but it is `p` so it isn't a shuffle. In other words, `chocolate` and `chips` are not in the right order.
- First check that `len(x)` + `len(y)` is equal to the length of `z`.
- The subproblem would be `S[i,j] = True` if and only if $X_1\dots X_i + Y_1\dots Y_i$ can be shuffled into $Z_1\dots Z_{i+j}$
- The recurrence relation is: $S[i,j] = ((Z_{i+j} == X_i) and (S[i-1,j)) or ((Z_{i+j} == Y_j) and (S[i,j-1))$
- This runs in $O(nm)$
