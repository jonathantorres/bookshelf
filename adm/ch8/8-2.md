*8.2 - Suppose you are given three strings of characters: `X`,`Y`,and `Z`, where `|X|=n`, `|Y|=m`, and `|Z|=n+m`. `Z` is said to be a shuffle of `X` and `Y` iff `Z` can be formed by interleaving the characters from `X` and `Y` in a way that maintains the left-to-right ordering of the characters from each string.*
- *Show that `cchocohilaptesis` a shuffle of `chocolateandchips`, but `chocochilatspe` is not.*
- *Give an efficient dynamic-programming algorithm that determines whether `Z` is a shuffle of `X` and `Y`. Hint: the values of the dynamic programming matrix you construct should be Boolean, not numeric*
***
- Start from the end and move all the way to the beginning. If you check `chocochilatspe` you take the last letter from `chocolate`, the next letter could be `s` or `t` but it is `p` so it isn't a shuffle.
