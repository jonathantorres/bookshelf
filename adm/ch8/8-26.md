*8.26 - Observe that when you cut a character out of a magazine, the character on the reverse side of the page is also removed. Give an algorithm to determine whether you can generate a given string by pasting cutouts from a given magazine. Assume that you are given a function that will identify the character and its position on the reverse side of the page for any given character position.*
***
Go through each character of the magazine and use the given function to check if the character on the other side is the one that we want if the current character of the magazine is not it. Given a long enough magazine, most words can be made from the characters on the magazine.
