*8.8 - In the single-processor scheduling problem, we are given a set of `n` jobs `J`. Each job `i` has a processing time `t[i]`, and a deadline `d[i]`. A feasible schedule is a permutation of the jobs such that when the jobs are performed in that order, every job is finished before its deadline. The greedy algorithm for single-processor scheduling selects the job with the earliest deadline first. Show that if a feasible schedule exists, then the schedule produced by this greedy algorithm is feasible.*
***
Using the following table, the greedy algorithm would give the most feasible schedule. Greedy -> J1, J2, J3, J4

| Jobs | Time | Deadline |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| J1   |   1  | 3d       |
| J2   |   4  | 6d       |
| J3   |   2  | 7d       |
| J4   |   5  | 10d      |
