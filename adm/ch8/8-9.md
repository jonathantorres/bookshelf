*8.9 - The knapsack problem is as follows: given a set of integers `S={s1,s2,...,sn}`, and a given target number `T`, find a subset of `S` that adds up exactly to `T`. For example, within `S={1,2,5,9,10}` there is a subset that adds up to `T=22` but not `T=23`.*

*Give a correct dynamic programming algorithm for knapsack that runs in `O(nT)`time*

- Subproblem: subset of integers $S_1\dots S_i$ and remaining capacity $X$
- Recurrence: $DP(i,x) = max(DP(i+1,x),DP(i+1,x-S_i)+1)$
- Running Time: $O(nT)$
