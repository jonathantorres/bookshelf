*2.3 - What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a function of `n`. Give the worst-case running time using Big Oh notation.*  
```
function prestiferous(n)
	r:=0
	for i:=1 to n do
		for j:=1 to i do
			for k:=j to i+j do
				for l:=1 to i+j-k do
					r:=r+1
	return(r)
```
***
If you call `prestiferous(3)` the value returned should be `28`
