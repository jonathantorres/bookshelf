*2.15 - Prove that if ![equation](https://github.com/jonathantorres/bookshelf/blob/master/adm/ch2/img/2-15.png)*
***
Choose `c1` to satisfy `f1(n) <= c1g1(n)` for all `n > n1`, `0` and `c2` to satisfy `f2(n) <= c2*g2(n)` for all `n > n2`, `0`.  
Note that `c1` and `c2` above can be substituted with `c3` such that `c3 = max(c1, c2)` and the conditions still hold.
