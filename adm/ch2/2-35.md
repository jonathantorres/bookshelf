*2.35 - Consider the following code fragment:*  
```
for i=1 to n do
    for j=i to 2*i do
        output "foobar"
```
Let `T(n)` denote the number of times `foobar` is printed as a function of `n`.  
- Express `T(n)` as a summation (actually two nested summations).
- Simplify the summation. Show your work.
