*2.34 - Assume that Christmas has `n` days. Exactly how many presents did my true love send me? (Do some research if you do not understand this question.) *  
***
Assuming that `n = 3` then 10 gifts:
```
1 + 3 + 6 = 10
```
Assuming that `n = 6` then 56 gifts:
```
1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 21 = 56
```
