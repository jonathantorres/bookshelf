*2.16 - Prove for all `k >= 1` and all sets of constants* ![equation](https://github.com/jonathantorres/bookshelf/blob/master/adm/ch2/img/2-16.png)
***
Assuming that `k = 5`, `a = 2` and `n = 3`  
```
O(n^k)
3^5
= 243
```
```
2(3^5) + 2(3^4) + 2(3^3) + 2(3^2) + 2(3^1) + 2(3^0)
2(243) + 2(81)  + 2(27)  + 2(9)   + 2(3)   + 2(1)
486    + 162    + 54     + 18     + 6      + 2
= 728
```

Not true, it does not hold.  
It holds `Î©(n^k)` instead
