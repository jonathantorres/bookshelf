*2.5 - Suppose the following algorithm is used to evaluate the polynomial:  ![equation](https://github.com/jonathantorres/bookshelf/blob/master/adm/ch2/img/2-5.png)*  

*1. How many multiplications are done in the worst-case? How many additions?*  
*2. How many multiplications are done on the average?*  
*3. Can you improve this algorithm?*  
```
p:=a[0];
xpower:=1;
for i:=1 to n do
	xpower:=x∗xpower;
	p:=p+a[i]∗xpower
end
```
***
- `2n` multiplications and `n` additions
- I'm guessing the same amount `2n`
- I don't see a way that it could be improved.
