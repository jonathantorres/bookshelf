## Chapter 2 - Notes
- Algorithms can be understood and studied in a language and machine independent manner.
- __**Worst case complexity**__ - is the function defined by the __**maximum**__ number of steps taken in any instance of size `n`.
- __**Best case complexity**__ - is the function defined by the __**minimum**__ number of steps taken in any instance of size `n`.
- __**Average case complexity**__ - is the function defined by the __**average**__ number of steps over all instances of size `n`.
- The __**Big Oh**__ notation and __**worst-case**__ analysis are tools that greatly simplify our ability to compare the efficiency of algorithms.
- Although esoteric functions arise in advanced algorithm analysis, a small variety of time complexities suffice and account for most algorithms that are widely used in practice.
- Logarithms arise whenever things are repeatedly halved or doubled.

Formal definitions of the __**Big Oh**__:

![big_oh](https://github.com/jonathantorres/bookshelf/blob/master/adm/ch2/img/big_oh.png) - Big Oh - Upper bound on `f(n)`

![big_omega](https://github.com/jonathantorres/bookshelf/blob/master/adm/ch2/img/big_omega.png) - Big Omega - Lower bound on `f(n)`

![big_theta](https://github.com/jonathantorres/bookshelf/blob/master/adm/ch2/img/big_theta.png) - Big Theta - `c1` is a lower bound on `f(n)` and `c2` is an upper bound on `f(n)`
