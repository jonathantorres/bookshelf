*2.20 - Find two functions `f(n)` and `g(n)` that satisfy the following relationship. If no such `f` and `g` exist, write `None`.*  
![equation](https://github.com/jonathantorres/bookshelf/blob/master/adm/ch2/img/2-20.png)
***
1. `f(n) = log log(n), g(n) = (log(n))^2`
2. `f(n) = n^2, g(n) = n^2 + log(n)`
3. `None`
4. `f(n) = n!, g(n) = 2n`
