*2.2 - What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a function of `n`. Give the worst-case running time using Big Oh notation.*  
```
function pesky(n)
	r:=0
	for i:=1 to n do
		for j:=1 to i do
			for k:=j to i+j do
				r:=r+1
	return(r)
```
***
If you call `pesky(3)` the value returned should be `17`
