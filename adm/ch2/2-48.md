*2.48 - You have eight balls all of the same size. Seven of them weigh the same, and one of them weighs slightly more. How can you find the ball that is heavier by using a balance and only two weighings?*  
***
Weight one half of the balls first and then the other half. Repeat the same process for the lighter half. This would result in 4 weighins in the worst case.
