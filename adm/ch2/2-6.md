*2.6 - Prove that the following algorithm for computing the maximum value in an array A[1..n] is correct.*  
```
function max(A)
	m:=A[1]
	for i:=2 to n do
		if A[i]>m then m:=A[i]
	return (m)
```
***
By looking at the code, it is correct. It first assumes that the first value is the max value. It loops through the array `n-1` times to check if the current items in the array is bigger that the value in `m`, if it is then `m` is updated to this new value.
