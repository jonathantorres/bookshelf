*2.43 - You are given a set `S` of `n` numbers. You must pick a subset `S'` of `k` numbers from `S` such that the probability of each element of `S` occurring in `S'` is equal (i.e., each is selected with probability `k/n`). You may make only one pass over the numbers. What if `n` is unknown? *  
***
Iterate over the elements in `S` from `i=0` until `S[i]` is empty. If `i<k`, `S'[i] = S[i]`. After that, for each `i`, replace a random element in `S'` with `S[i]`
