*2.50 - A Ramanujam number can be written two different ways as the sum of two cubes i.e., there exist distinct `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` such that `a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3`. Generate all Ramanujam numbers where `a,b,c,d < n`.*  
***
If `n=5`, `a=2`, `b=1`, `c=4` and `d=3`
```
2^3 + 1^3 = 4^3 + 3^3
8   + 1   = 64  + 27
9         = 91
```
Can't prove this.
