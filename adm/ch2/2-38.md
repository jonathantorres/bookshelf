*2.38 - In grade school, you learned to multiply long numbers on a digit-by-digit basis, so that `127x211 = 127x1 + 127x10 + 127x200 = 26,397`. Analyze the time complexity of multiplying two n-digit numbers with this method as a function of `n` (assume constant base size). Assume that single-digit by single-digit addition or multiplication takes `O(1)` time.*  
***
It would be `O(n^2)`
