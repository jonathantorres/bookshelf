*2.23 - For each of these questions, briefly explain your answer.*  
- *(a) If I prove that an algorithm takes `O(n^2)` worst-case time, is it possible that it takes `O(n)` on some inputs?*  
- *(b) If I prove that an algorithm takes `O(n^2)` worst-case time, is it possible that it takes `O(n)` on all inputs?*
- *(c) If I prove that an algorithm takes `Θ(n^2)` worst-case time, is it possible that it takes `O(n)` on some inputs?*
- *(d) If I prove that an algorithm takes `Θ(n^2)` worst-case time, is it possible that it takes `O(n)` on all inputs?*
- *(e) Is the function `f(n) = Θ(n^2)`, where `f(n) = 100n^2` for even `n` and `f(n) = 20n^2 − n log2 n` for odd `n`?*  
***
a) Yes, it could be possible on insertion, or selection sort.  
b) Yes  
c) Yes, it could be possible on insertion, or selection sort.  
d) No, not on all inputs. Since it's already `O(n^2)` in the worst case.  
e) Yes
