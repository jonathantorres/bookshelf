*7.19 - Use a random number generator (rng04) that generates numbers from `{0,1,2,3,4}` with equal probability to write a random number generator that generates numbers from 0 to 7 (rng07) with equal probability. What are expected number of calls to rng04 per call of rng07?*
***
I'd say just one call, and we add 3 to the call from (rng04), so that the maximum possible number doesn't go over 7 or is not greater than 7.
