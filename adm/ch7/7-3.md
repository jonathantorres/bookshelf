*7.3 - Design and implement an algorithm for testing whether two graphs are isomorphic to each other. The graph isomorphism problem is discussed in Section 16.9 (page 550). With proper pruning, graphs on hundreds of vertices can be tested reliably.*
***
Given 2 graphs `G1` and `G2`:
- Compare the number of vertices in `G1` and `G2` for equality.
- Compare the number of edges in `G1` and `G2` for equality.
- Sort the vertices of `G1` and `G2` by degree and compare the degrees of each pair of vertices from `G1` and `G2` for equality.
- Use backtracking to generate a mapping of the vertices.
