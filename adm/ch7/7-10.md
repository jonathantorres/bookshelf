*7.10 - Design and implement an algorithm for solving the minimum vertex coloring problem discussed in Section 16.7 (page 544)*
***
- Resort to backtracking
- Incremental methods are the heuristic of choice for vertex coloring.
- Vertices are colored sequentially, with the colors chosen in response to colors already assigned in the vertex neighborhood.
- Insert the vertices in nonincreasing order of degree, since high-degree vertices have more color constraints and so are most likely to require an additional color if inserted late.
- Incremental methods can be further improved by using color interchange.
