*7.8 - Design and implement an algorithm for solving the maximum satisfiability problem discussed in Section 14.10 (page 472)*
***
- Employing heuristics that give good but not optimal solutions is usually the better approach in practice.
- Provide NP-Completeness first.
- To solve the satisfiability exactly there's no much choice rather than backtracking algorithms, such as the David-Putman procedure.
- `2^m` assignments to test in the worst case.
