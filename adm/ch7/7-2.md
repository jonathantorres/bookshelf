*7.2 - Multisets are allowed to have repeated elements. A multiset of `n` items may thus have fewer than `n!` distinct permutations. For example, `{1,1,2,2}` has only six different permutations: `{1,1,2,2}`, `{1,2,1,2}`, `{1,2,2,1}`, `{2,1,1,2}`, `{2,1,2,1}` and `{2,2,1,1}`. Design and implement an efficient algorithm for constructing all permutations of a multiset.*
***
- Keep an array of the current saved permutation
- We backtrack when an item is the same as the current one in the set `S`.
- Generate all the posibilities for the next element `n-1` and recurse from there.
