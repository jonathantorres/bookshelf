*7.11 - Design and implement an algorithm for solving the minimum edge coloring problem discussed in Section 16.8 (page 548)*
***
- Solved with Vizing's theorem.
- Any graph with a maximum vertex degree of `Δ` can be edge colored using at most `Δ+1` colors, since all edges incident on any vertex must be distinct colors.
- `O(nmΔ)` algorithm
- An edge-coloring problem on `G` can be converted to the problem of finding a vertex coloring on the linegraph `L(G)`, which has a vertex of `L(G)` for each edge of `G` and an edge of `L(G)` if and only if the two edges of `G` share a common vertex.
