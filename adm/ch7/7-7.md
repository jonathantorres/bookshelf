*7.7 - Design and implement an algorithm for solving the bandwidth minimization problem discussed in Section 13.2 (page 398)*
***
- Only options to solve this is brute force and search heuristics
- Perform BFS from vertex `v`
- All of the vertices that are distance `1` from `v` to it's immediate right, followed by vertices at distance `z` and so forth until all the vertices in `G` are accounted for.
