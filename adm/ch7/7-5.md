*7.5 - Design and implement an algorithm for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem. Given graphs `G` and `H`, does there exist a subgraph `H′` of `H` such that `G` is isomorphic to `H′`? How does your program perform on such special cases of subgraph isomorphism as Hamiltonian cycle, clique, independent set, and graph isomorphism?*
***
This is no different than the graph isomorphism problem. You just have to add an extra backtracking step in the beginning to form every possible subgraph of the original graph, and test them one by one for graph isomorphism.
