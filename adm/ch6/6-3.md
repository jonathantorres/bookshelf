*6.3 - Assume that all edges in the graph have distinct edge weights (i.e., no pair of edges have the same weight). Is the path between a pair of vertices in a minimum spanning tree necessarily a shortest path between the two vertices in the full graph? Give a proof or a counterexample.*
***
No, the following graph is a counterexample. MST has a weight of 6 with edges `{A.B}, {B,C}, {C,D}`. In the full graph the Minimum distance between A and D is 4.
