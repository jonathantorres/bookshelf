*6.3 - Assume that all edges in the graph have distinct edge weights (i.e., no pair of edges have the same weight). Is the path between a pair of vertices in a minimum spanning tree necessarily a shortest path between the two vertices in the full graph? Give a proof or a counterexample.*
***
- No, counterexample:
- `G=(V,E)`: `((A,B,C,D), ({A,B}, {B,C}, {C,D}, {D,A}), (1,2,3,4))`
- MST has a weight of 6 with edges `{A.B}, {B,C}, {C,D}`. In the full graph the Minimum distance between A and D is 4.
