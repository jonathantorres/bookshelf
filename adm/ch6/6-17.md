*6.17 - Either prove the following or give a counterexample:*
- *a) Is the path between a pair of vertices in a minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph necessarily the shortest (minimum weight) path?*
- *b) Suppose that the minimum spanning tree of the graph is unique. Is the path between a pair of vertices in a minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph necessarily the shortest (minimum weight) path?*
***
- a) No, the graph on page 196. of the book gives a very good counterexample
- b) No, A counterexample to this is a square graph. The MST is `A->B->C->D` and the edge of weight 8 is never included. The path from A to D through the MST is 10, but the path from A->D is weight 8.
