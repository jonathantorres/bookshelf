*6.25 - An edge cover of an undirected graph `G=(V, E)` is a set of edges such that each vertex in the graph is incident to at least one edge from the set. Give an efficient algorithm, based on matching, to find the minimum-size edge cover for `G`.*
***
This can be solved by maximum matching. General matching would require Edmonds Blossom algorithm. Include an arbitrary edge for every uncovered vertex.
