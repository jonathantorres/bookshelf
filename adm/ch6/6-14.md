*6.14 - The single-destination shortest path problem for a directed graph seeks the shortest path from every vertex to a specified vertex `v`. Give an efficient algorithm to solve the single-destination shortest paths problem.*
***
Dijkstra's algorithm is the most suitable for this type of problem, it will find the shortest path in `O(n^2)`. Run this Dijkstra's algorithm from every other vertex to the vertex `v`
