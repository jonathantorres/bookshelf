*6.14 - The single-destination shortest path problem for a directed graph seeks the shortest path from every vertex to a specified vertex `v`. Give an efficient algorithm to solve the single-destination shortest paths problem.*
***
Dijkstra's algorithm is the most suitable for this type of problem, it will find the shortest path in $O(n^2)$. Run Dijkstra's algorithm on every vertex other than `v`. This would run in $O(n^3)$
