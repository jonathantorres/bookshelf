*6.7 - a) Let `T` be a minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph `G`. Construct a new graph `G′` by adding a weight of `k` to every edge of `G`. Do the edges of `T` form a minimum spanning tree of `G′`? Prove the statement or give a counterexample.*
*b) Let `P={s,...,t}` describe a shortest weighted path between vertices `s` and `t` of a weighted graph `G`. Construct a new graph `G′` by adding a weight of `k` to every edge of `G`. Does `P` describe a shortest path from `s` to `t` in `G′`? Prove the statement or give a counterexample.*
***
- a) Yes, the edges of `T` still form the MST. They are not affected by the change since all the weights in the graph are the same.
- b) No, it does not, when increasing the weights of the edges, the shortest path between `s` and `t` will be different.
