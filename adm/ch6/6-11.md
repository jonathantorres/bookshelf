*6.11 - Modify Prim’s algorithm so that it runs in time `O(n log k)` on a graph that has only `k` different edges costs.*
***
- Start with an arbitrary vertex. Put the edges of this vertex in a min heap, where each node of the heap contains a value equal to the weight of the edge, and a list of destination vertices.
- While min heap is not empty, take out the min edge, remove the destination vertex from the list, and add the edge to the tree.
- For each of the `n` vertices, we will extract the min edge from the heap. The heap has a size of `k`, and each extraction operation takes `log(k)` time. So total time will be `O(n∗log(k))`
