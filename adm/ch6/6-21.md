*6.21 - Let `G=(V, E)` be a weighted acyclic directed graph with possibly negative edge weights. Design a linear-time algorithm to solve the single-source shortest-path problem from a given source `v`*
***
Perform a topological sort of the graph. Go through these vertices in order, if it's accesible update it's children with new distance if the new distance is shorter than the previous one. Topological sorting makes sure that we don't backtrack. This would run in `O(n+m)` which is linear time.
