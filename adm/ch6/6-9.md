*6.9 - Consider the problem of finding a minimum weight connected subset `T` of edges from a weighted connected graph `G`. The weight of `T` is the sum of all the edge weights in `T`.*
- *a) Why is this problem not just the minimum spanning tree problem? Hint: think negative weight edges.*
- *b) Give an efficient algorithm to compute the minimum weight connected subset `T`*
***
- a) It's not an entire MST problem if we allow negative weight edges, because if we don't allow negative weights, then `T` would be the same as the MST.
- b) Run a preprocessing pass before running Kruskal's algorithm, add all edges together and then run Kruskal's algorithm normally until finished.
