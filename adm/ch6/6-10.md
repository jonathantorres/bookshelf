*6.10 - Let `G=(V, E)` be an undirected graph. A set `F âŠ† E` of edges is called a feedback-edge set if every cycle of `G` has at least one edge in `F`.*
- *a) Suppose  that `G` is  unweighted. Design an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-size feedback-edge set.*
- *b) Suppose that `G` is a weighted undirected graph with positive edge weights. Design an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-weight feedback-edge set.*

- a) Since the graph is unweighted, I'm sure this problem can be solved with BFS/DFS. Checking every edge in turn, to see if a cycle of `G` contains one edge in `F`.
- b) We can use BFS/DFS here as well. Or a modified version of Kruskal's algorithm. Since we have to visit every edge and node of `G`.
