*6.10 - Let `G=(V, E)` be an undirected graph. A set `F âŠ† E` of edges is called a feedback-edge set if every cycle of `G` has at least one edge in `F`.*
- *a) Suppose  that `G` is  unweighted. Design an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-size feedback-edge set.*
- *b) Suppose that `G` is a weighted undirected graph with positive edge weights. Design an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-weight feedback-edge set.*
***
- a) Do a DFS starting from any vertex. Traverse the tree of discovery upward and once a backedge is found, add the edges from the current vertex up to the ancestor. Repeat this process and keep the set of edges in a array or hashtable. The entry with the smallest set is the feedback edge set.  
- b) Find the MST of `G`. Use the DFS tree described above and add the edges of every cycle into a set. Select the set that adds up to the minimum weight of its edges.
