*6.23 - Arbitrage is the use of discrepancies in currency-exchange rates to make a profit. For example, there may be a small window of time during which 1 U.S. dollar buys 0.75 British pounds, 1 British pound buys 2 Australian dollars, and 1 Australian dollar buys 0.70 U.S. dollars. At such a time, a smart trader can trade one U.S.dollar and end up with `0.75×2×0.7=1.05` U.S. dollars a profit of 5%. Suppose that there are `n` currencies `c1, ..., cn` and an `n×n` table `R` of exchange rates, such that one unit of currency `c[i]` buys `R[i, j]` units of currency `c[j]`. Devise and analyze an algorithm to determine the maximum value of:*
- *`R[c1,ci1]·R[ci1,ci2]···R[cik−1,cik]·R[cik,c1]`*
- *Hint: think all-pairs shortest path.*
***
This problem can be reduced to a Floyd-Warshall algorithm if you take logs of all currency-exchange rates: `a x b = c` then `ln(a) + ln(b) + ln(c)`
