*6.18 - In certain graph problems, vertices have can have weights instead of or in addition to the weights of edges. Let `Cv` be the cost of vertex `v`, and `C(x,y)` the cost of the edge `(x, y)`. This problem is concerned with finding the cheapest path between vertices `a` and `b` in a graph `G`. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges and vertices encountered on the path.*
- *a) Suppose that each edge in the graph has a weight of zero (while non-edges have a cost of `Infinity`). Assume that `Cv= 1` for all vertices `1 ≤ v ≤ n` (i.e. , all vertices have the same cost). Give an efficient algorithm to find the cheapest path from `a` to `b` and its time complexity.*
- *b) Now suppose that the vertex costs are not constant (but are all positive) and the edge costs remain as above. Give an efficient algorithm to find the cheapest path from `a` to `b` and its time complexity.*
- *c) Now suppose that both the edge and vertex costs are not constant (but are all positive). Give an efficient algorithm to find the cheapest path from `a` to `b` and its time complexity.*

- a) If I understand this correctly, it seems that the graph `G` is unweighted, the edges have a cost of 0 and vertices a cost of 1. Running a BFS starting from vertex `a` will return the shortest path to `b`.  
- b) This can be found using Dijkstra's algorithm by using the weight of the vertex as the way to decide the cost of a path (instead of the edges)  
- c) Same as above but computing the cost by using both the edge cost and the cost of both vertices of the edge
