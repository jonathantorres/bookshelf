*6.4 - Can Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm yield different minimum spanning trees? Explain why or why not.*
***
Yes, it's possible. Since Kruskal's algorithm will start adding the edges into the tree (avoiding cycles) in sorted order it could yield a different MST, especially in the cases in which there are more than 1 edge with the same weight in the graph
