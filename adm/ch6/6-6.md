*6.6 - Suppose we are given the minimum spanning tree `T` of a given graph `G` (with `n` vertices and `m` edges) and a new edge `e=(u, v)` of weight `w` that we will add to `G`. Give an efficient algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph `G+e`. Your algorithm should run in `O(n)` time to receive full credit.*
***
Use a modified version of Kruskal's algorithm with a union-find data structure. This will find the MST of `G+e`.
