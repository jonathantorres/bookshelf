*6.20 - Can we modify Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to solve the single-source longest path problem by changing minimum to maximum? If so, then prove your algorithm correct. If not, then provide a counterexample.
***
Yes, I think is possible, we would have to modify the algorithm to do the inverse, instead of minimum, look for a maximum value. Similar to working with a heap or a comparison function for a sorting algorithm.
