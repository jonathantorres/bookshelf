*6.15 - Let `G=(V, E)` be an undirected weighted graph, and let `T` be the shortest-path spanning tree rooted at a vertex `v`. Suppose now that all the edge weights in `G` are increased by a constant number `k`. Is `T` still the shortest-path spanning tree from `v`?*
***
No, any graph with a shortest-path spanning tree will be altered or possibly it will no longer be the MST if a constant value is added to every edge.
