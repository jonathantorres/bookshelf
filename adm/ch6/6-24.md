*6.24 - A matching in a graph is a set of disjoint edges i.e, edges that do not share any vertices in common. Give a linear-time algorithm to find a maximum matching in a tree.*
***
Iterate over every vertex in the graph, if that vertex is in the set then skip it, otherwise add one of it's edges to another vertex that's also not on the set.
