*6.2 - Is the path between two vertices in a minimum spanning tree necessarily a shortest path between the two vertices in the full graph? Give a proof or a counter-example.*
***
No, in a MST we only care about the weight of the next tree edge. In shortest path, we want to include the closest outside vertex.
