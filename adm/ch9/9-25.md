*9.25 - In the maximum-satisfiability problem, we seek a truth assignment that satisfies as many clauses as possible. Give an heuristic that always satisfies at least half as many clauses as the optimal solution.*
***
- This is an NP-Hard problem. 
- But it is possible to assign truth values in a way to make three out of four clauses true, every truth assignment will attempt to do this. 
- The solution for this leads to the solution of the boolean satisfiability problem.
