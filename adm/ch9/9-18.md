*9.18 - Prove that the vertex cover problem (does there exist a subset `S` of `k` vertices in a graph `G` such that every edge in `G` is incident upon at least one vertex in `S`?) remains NP-complete even when all the vertices in the graph are restricted to have even degrees.*
***
Yes, it remains NP-complete, given the following graph:
