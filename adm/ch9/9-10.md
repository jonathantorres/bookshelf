*9.10 - Show that the following problem is NP-complete:*
- *Problem: Dense subgraph*
- *Input: A graph `G`, and integers `k` and `y`.*
- *Output: Does `G` contain a subgraph with exactly `k` vertices and at least `y` edges?*
***
Mantain a count of vertices and a count of edges, use a procedure to find a subgraph, if a subgraph is found do a BFS on it and count every edge and vertex on it:
```
Dense(G,k,y) {
    s = find_sub(G)
    if s {
        count every edge and vertex of s
    }
}
```
