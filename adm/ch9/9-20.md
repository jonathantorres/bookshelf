*9.20 - Prove that the following problem is NP-complete:*
- *Problem: Feedback Vertex Set*
- *Input: A directed graph `G=(V,A)` and positive integer `k`.*
- *Output: Is there a subset `V′ ∈ V` such that `|V′| ≤ k`, such that deleting the vertices of `V′` from `G` leaves a DAG?*
***
- Create a graph `G(V,E)` and go through each vertex in order until `k`. Then, delete these vertices and call a subroutine `Dag(G)` to see if the remaining graph is actually a DAG.

Reduction from Vertex Cover:
```
VertexCover(H) {
  G = graph created from H as described above
  K = a constant integer greater than or equal to 1
  FeedbackVertexSet(G,K)
}
```
