*9.3 - Suppose we are given a subroutine which can solve the traveling salesman decision problem of page 318 in, say, linear time. Give an efficient algorithm to find the actual TSP tour by making a polynomial number of calls to this subroutine.*
***
- First determine the length of the shortest TSP tour
- Loop over all the edges
- If the graph with the edge removed has a TSP tour of lenght `k`, remove this edge
- After the loop, we are left with a graph containing the vertices of the original graph connected by a subset of the edges of the original graph
- This reduced graph should contain a TSP tour of length `k`
