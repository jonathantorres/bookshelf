*9.7 - An instance of the set cover problem consists of a set `X` of `n` elements, a family `F` of subsets of `X`, and an integer `k`. The question is, does there exist `k` subsets from `F` whose union is `X`? For example, if `X={1,2,3,4}` and `F={{1,2},{2,3},{4},{2,4}}`, there does not exist a solution for `k=2`, but there does for `k=3` (for example, `{1,2},{2,3},{4}`). Prove that set cover is NP-complete with a reduction from vertex cover.*
***
- Create a set of edges for each vertex `u`, where the set contains all the edges that have one vertex in `u`
- Let the large set `x` be the set of all edges in the graph. Pseudocode below:

```
VertexCover(G) {
  X = all the vertices of G
  F = a family of subsets from X
  k = 2
  SetCover(X, F, k)
}
```
