*9.14 - Show that the following problem is NP-complete:*
- *Problem: Knapsack*
- *Input: A set `S` of `n` items, such that the `ith` item has value `v[i]` and weight `w[i]`. Two positive integers: weight limit `W` and value requirement `V`*
- *Output: Does there exist a subset `S′ ∈ S` such that `∑i ∈ S′ wi ≤ W` and `∑i ∈ S′ vi ≥ V`? (Hint: start from integer partition.)*
***
- Create graph `G` such that an edge between vertices `(vi, vj)` contains the required weight of both vertices
- Go through each edge until the weight equals `W` but as long as `V` is greater than the sum of each vertex traversed.

Pseudocode and reduction from Integer Partition:
```
IntegerPartition(n) {
  S = The graph G described above (built from n)
  W = weight calculated after going through each edge of S
  V = value calculated after going through each edge of S
  Knapsack(S, W, V)
}
```
