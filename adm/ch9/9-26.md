*9.26 - Consider the following heuristic for vertex cover. Construct a DFS tree of the graph, and delete all the leaves from this tree. What remains must be a vertex cover of the graph. Prove that the size of this cover is at most twice as large as optimal.*
***
- Once we construct the DFS tree, count the inner nodes that are left. 
- If we have a graph of $n$ nodes, and we delete the leaves from the DFS tree, any backedges of the DFS tree will amount for the cover of the graph.
