*9.9 - The low-degree spanning tree problem is as follows. Given a graph `G` and an integer `k`, does `G` contain a spanning tree such that all vertices in the tree have degree at most `k` (obviously, only tree edges count towards the degree)? For example, in the following graph, there is no spanning tree such that all vertices have a degree less than three.*
- *Prove that the low-degree spanning tree problem is NP-hard with a reduction from Hamiltonian path.*
- *Now consider the high-degree spanning tree problem, which is as follows. Given a graph `G` and an integer `k`, does `G` contain a spanning tree whose highest degree vertex is at least `k`? In the previous example, there exists a spanning tree with a highest degree of 8. Give an efficient algorithm to solve the high-degree spanning tree problem, and an analysis of its time complexity*

***
- This problem is hard since Hamiltonian path is also hard.
- Use the hamiltonian path procedure to make sure that every vertex is visited at least once, return false once a vertex greater than `k` is found

```
HamiltonianPath(G) {
  S = A spanning tree of G
  k = 2
  LowDegree(S, k)
}
```
