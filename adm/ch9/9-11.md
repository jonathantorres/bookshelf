*9.11 - Show that the following problem is NP-complete:*
- *Problem:Clique, no-clique*
- *Input: An undirected graph `G=(V, E)` and an integer `k`.*
- *Output: Does `G` contain both a clique of size `k` and an independent set of size `k`.*
***
Call a clique subroutine on `G` to get the size of it, also call a subroutine for independent set of size `k`, if both values of the subroutines are equal to `k`, then `G` satisfies the clique, no-clique.
