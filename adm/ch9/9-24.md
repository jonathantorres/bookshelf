*9.24 - It was a long open question whether the decision problem "Is integer `n` a composite number, in other words, not prime?" can be computed in time polynomial in the size of its input. Why doesn’t the following algorithm suffice to prove it is in `P`, since it runs in `O(n)` time?*
```
PrimalityTesting(n)
    composite := false
    for i := 2 to n−1 do
        if (n mod i) = 0 then
            composite := true
```
***
- Because it's just doing a modulo check on the value, instead of finding the multiple numbers that multiply to it's result.
- This is just doing a check, instead of calculating the requested value.
