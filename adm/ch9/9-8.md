*9.8 - The baseball card collector problem is as follows. Given packets `P[1],...,P[m]`, each of which contains a subset of this year's baseball cards, is it possible to collect all the year's cards by buying `â‰¤k` packets?* 

*For example, if the players are `{Aaron, Mays, Ruth, Skiena}` and the packets are `{{Aaron,Mays}, {Mays,Ruth}, {Skiena}, {Mays, Skiena}}`, there does not exist a solution for `k=2`, but there does for `k=3`, such as `{Aaron, Mays},{Mays,Ruth},{Skiena}`*

*Prove that the baseball card collector problem is NP-hard using a reduction from vertex cover.*
***
- This is the same problem as set cover
- Use a graph where each vertex represent the card that you want and the edge the packet from where it belongs. Use the vertex cover procedure to solve the card collector problem:
```
Collector(packets, k) {
    foreach packet P {
        VertexCover(P)
    }
}
```
