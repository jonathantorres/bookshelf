*9.23 - Show that the following problems are in NP:*
- *Does graph `G` have a simple path (i.e., with no vertex repeated) of length `k`?*
- *Is integer `n` composite (i.e., not prime)?*
- *Does graph `G` have a vertex cover of size `k`?*
***
- This can be done in linear time, therefore is not in NP
- This can be solved in polynomial time, therefore is not in NP
- We have to find a vertex cover to answer the question, the vertex cover problem is NP-complete. Therefore, to find a vertex cover of size $k$ is also NP-complete.
