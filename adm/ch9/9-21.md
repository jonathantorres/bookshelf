*9.21 - A Hamiltonian path `P` is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. The problem of testing whether a graph `G` contains a Hamiltonian path is NP-complete. There does not have to be an edge in `G` from the ending vertex to the starting vertex of `P`, unlike in the Hamiltonian cycle problem. Give an `O(n+m)` time algorithm to test whether a directed acyclic graph `G` (a DAG) contains a Hamiltonian path. (Hint: think about topological sorting and DFS.)*
***
- By going through each vertex and edge, we can construct the DFS tree and then do a topological sort on it.
- If there's a consecutive path on the result of the sort, then there's a Hamiltonian path on the DAG. 
- Before doing the sorting, make sure there are no repeating vertices, since we are dealing with a DAG.
