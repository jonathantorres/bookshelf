*9.15 - Show that the following problem is NP-complete:*
- *Problem: Hamiltonian Path*
- *Input: A graph `G`, and vertices `s` and `t`.*
- *Output: Does `G` contain a path which starts from `s`, ends at `t`, and visits all vertices without visiting any vertex more than once? (Hint: start from Hamiltonian cycle.)*
***
- Construct a complete weighted graph `G=(V,E)`, start from vertex `V` and keep track of each vertex visited, maybe in a cache (array) once an already visited vertex is found, then the path cannot be found.
