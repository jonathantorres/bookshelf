*9.17 - Prove that the following problem is NP-complete:*
- *Problem: Dominating Set*
- *Input: A graph `G=(V, E)` and positive integer `k`*
- *Output: Is there a subset `V′ ∈ V` such that `|V′| ≤ k` where for each vertex `x ∈ V` either `x ∈ V′` or there exists an edge `(x, y)`, where `y ∈ V′`.*
***
Reduction from Vertex Cover:

```
VertexCover(H,k) {
  G = for each edge in H create {u,v}, create a new vertex uv and edge {u,uv} and edge {v,uv}
  DominatingSet(G,k)
}
```
