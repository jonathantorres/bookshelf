*9.12 - An Eulerian cycle is a tour that visits every edge in a graph exactly once.An Eulerian subgraph is a subset of the edges and vertices of a graph that has an Eulerian cycle. Prove that the problem of finding the number of edges in the largest Eulerian subgraph of a graph is NP-hard. (Hint: the Hamiltonian circuit problem is NP-hard even if each vertex in the graph is incident upon exactly three edges.)*
***
- The hamiltonian cycle is already NP-hard. We need to find the Eulerian subgraph first. If there's only one such subgraph, then every edge of this graph is the solution.
- Count the number of edges of the returned (if any) subgraph.
