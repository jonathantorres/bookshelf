## Chapter 9 - Notes
- Reductions are a way to show that two problems are essentially identical. A fast algorithm (or the lack of one) for one of the problems implies a fast algorithm (or lack of one) for the other.
- A small set of NP-complete problems (3-SAT, vertex cover, integer partition, and Hamiltonian cycle) suffice to prove the hardness of most other hard problems.
- Approximation algorithms guarantee answers that are always close to the optimal solution. They can provide a practical approach to dealing with NP-complete problems.
- NP-complete means that there is not a fast solution for a problem. It's hard to solve on the worst case.
- Polynomial time = `n^2, n^3`. Fast enough
- Exponential time = `2^n, 3^n`. Too slow
