*9.13 - Show that the following problem is NP-complete:*
- *Problem: Hitting Set*
- *Input: A collection `C` of subsets of a set `S`, positive integer `k`*
- *Output: Does `S` contain a subset `S′` such that `|S′| ≤ k` and each subset in `C` contains at least one element from `S′`?*
***
- Label the vertices 1 to `n`. Let `S` be the set `{1,2,3...n}`
- The subset for each edge `{u,v}` which contains the number labels of `u` and `v`

Reduction from vertex cover:
```
VertexCover(V,E,j) {
  S = {V[0]...V[n]}
  C = {E[0]...E[n]}
  k = j
  
  HittingSet(S,C,k)
}
```
