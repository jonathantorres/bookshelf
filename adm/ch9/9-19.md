*9.19 - Prove that the following problem is NP-complete:*
- *Problem: Set Packing*
- *Input: A collection `C` of subsets of a set `S`, positive integer `k`*
- *Output: Does `S` contain at least `k` disjoint subsets (i.e., such that none of these subsets have any elements in common?).*
***
Create graph $G(V,E)$ as such that every vertex $v$ is connected to edge $e$ where both vertices are a set that has edge weight elements in common:
```
SetPacking(C,k) {
    for each c[i] in C {
        check each disjoint c[i] to see if it contains k subsets
    }
}
```
