*1.6 - The set cover problem is as follows: given a set of subsets $S_1, \dots,S_m$ of the universal set $U={1,\dots,n}$, find the smallest subset of subsets $T\subset S$ such that $\cup _t_i \in T^t_i = U$. For example, there are the following subsets, `S1={1,3,5}`, `S2={2,4}`, `S3={1,4}`, and `S4={2,5}`. The set cover would then be $S_1$ and $S_2$. Find a counterexample for the following algorithm: Select the largest subset for the cover, and then delete all its elements from the universal set. Repeat by adding the subset containing the largest number of uncovered elements until all are covered.*

Where `U={4,5,6,7}` and `S={{5,6},{7},{4,5,6},{6,7}}`  
Set cover is $S_1$ and $S_2$  
`S={{5,6},{7},{5,6,3},{6,7}}`  
No set cover `4` is missing
