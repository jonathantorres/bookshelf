*1.9 - Prove the correctness of the following sorting algorithm.*
```
function bubblesort (A : list[1..n])
    var int i, j
    for i from n to 1
        for j from 1 to iâˆ’1
            if (A[j] > A[j+1])
                swap the values of A[j] and A[j+1]
```
***

If `A = {5,3,9}` and `n = 3`  
- First pass through `A = {5,3,9}`
- Second pass through `A = {3,5,9}`
