By using negative numbers: $-3 + -2 = -5$ is less than $min(-3, -2) = -3$. This means that: $-5 < -3$

#### 1-2

By using one of the numbers as negative: $-4 x 2 = -8$ is less than $min(-4, 2) = -4$. This means that: $-8 < -4$

#### 1-3

Route A->D->B is fastest (but longer) since there is a traffic light between A->C in the shorter A->C->B route.

#### 1-4

Route A->C->D->E->F->B has 4 turns but it is shorter than the longer A->I->H->G->B route with 3 turns.

a. $S=\\{3,4,9,4\\}$ where $T=17$  
b. $S=\\{8,4,2,5\\}$ with $T=14$  
c. $S=\\{7,3,9,2\\}$ with $T=18$

Let $U=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and $S_1=\\{3,1\\}$, $S_2=\\{2\\}$, $S_3=\\{5\\}$, $S_4=\\{1,2\\}$, $S_5=\\{1,4\\}$ and $S_6=\\{4\\}$. The algorithm will find the set cover $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_5$ which is correct but not the most optimal, there will be two 1's repeated in sets $S_1$ and $S_5$. The most optimal and correct set cover is $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_6$.

Probably not, I do not own that many books. Assuming that my school library contains approximately 20,000 books and each averages 400 pages, then there are about 8 million pages.

#### 1-20

If there are about 530 words per page and about 720 pages in the book, then there are approximately 381,600 words in the book.

- I would say microseconds
- In less than a microsecond
- About 100 trillion

#### 1-25

a. Proportional to `n^2`, 10 seconds on the worst case  
b. Less than 1 second for sure

I believe the first one (Figure 1.5) since it's using a very specific circular form. It should work effectively as long as the pattern of the points are in a circular shape.

If we are using a timer to measure the time for each horse's race, then only 5 races would be needed. If each horse needs to race each other, then 6 races. 5 races to get the top 5 and then another race for the top 3.

If there are about 1 million pianos, then assuming every piano owner has 2 tuners, then about 2 million piano tuners.

#### 1-31

If there are about 30,000 per state then about 1.5 million in the U.S.

Assuming there are 1,000 pages in the phone book, then about 250 times.
