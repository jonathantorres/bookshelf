#### 1-1

By using negative numbers: $-3 + -2 = -5$ is less than $min(-3, -2) = -3$. This means that: $-5 < -3$

#### 1-2

By using one of the numbers as negative: $-4 x 2 = -8$ is less than $min(-4, 2) = -4$. This means that: $-8 < -4$

#### 1-3

Use a curve for one of the roads:

#### 1-4

Make short turns and use long straight roads:

a. $S=\\{3,4,9,4\\}$ where $T=17$  
b. $S=\\{8,4,2,5\\}$ with $T=14$  
c. $S=\\{7,3,9,2\\}$ with $T=20$

#### 1-6

In the case where $U=\\{4,5,6,7\\}$ and $S=\\{\\{5,6\\},\\{7\\},\\{4,5,6\\},\\{6,7\\}\\}$ then the set cover is $S1$ and $S2$ $S=\\{\\{5,6\\},\\{7\\},\\{5,6,3\\},\\{6,7\\}\\}$. No set cover $4$ is missing.

Probably not, I do not own that many books. Assuming that my school library contains approximately 20,000 books and each averages 400 pages, then there are about 8 million pages.

#### 1-20

If there are about 530 words per page and about 720 pages in the book, then there are approximately 381,600 words in the book.

120 Hours. 5 days

- I would say microseconds
- In less than a microsecond
- About 100 trillion

#### 1-25

a. Proportional to `n^2`, 10 seconds on the worst case  
b. Less than 1 second for sure

I believe the first one (Figure 1.5) since it's using a very specific circular form. It should work effectively as long as the pattern of the points are in a circular shape.

If we are using a timer to measure the time for each horse's race, then only 5 races would be needed. If each horse needs to race each other, then 6 races. 5 races to get the top 5 and then another race for the top 3.

#### 1-30

If there are about 1 million pianos, then assuming every piano owner has 2 tuners, then about 2 million piano tuners.

#### 1-31

If there are about 30,000 per state then about 1.5 million in the U.S.

#### 1-32

#### 1-33

50,000 miles

#### 1-34

Assuming there are 1,000 pages in the phone book, then about 250 times.
