*1.29 - There are 25 horses. At most, 5 horses can race together at a time. You must determine the fastest, second fastest, and third fastest horses. Find the minimum number of races in which this can be done.*
***
If we are using a timer to measure the time for each horse's race, then only 5 races would be needed.  
If each horse needs to race each other, then 6 races. 5 races to get the top 5 and then another race for the top 3.
