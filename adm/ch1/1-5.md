*1.5 - The knapsack problem is as follows: given a set of integers `S={s1,s2,â€¦,sn}`, and a target number `T`, find a subset of `S` which adds up exactly to `T`. For example, there exists a subset within `S={1,2,5,9,10}` that adds up to `T=22` but not `T=23`. Find counterexamples to each of the following algorithms for the knapsack problem. That is, giving an `S` and `T` such that the subset is selected using the algorithm does not leave the knapsack completely full, even though such a solution exists.*  

- *A. Put the elements of `S` in the knapsack in left to right order if they fit, i.e. the first-fit algorithm.*
- *B. Put the elements of `S` in the knapsack from smallest to largest, i.e. the best-fit algorithm.*
- *C. Put the elements of `S` in the knapsack from largest to smallest.*
***

A. `S={3,4,9,4}` with `T=17`  
B. `S={8,4,2,5}` with `T=14`  
C. `S={7,3,9,2}` with `T=20`
