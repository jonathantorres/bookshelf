*4.11 - Design an `O(n)` algorithm that, given a list of `n` elements, finds all the elements that appear more than `n/2` times in the list. Then, design an `O(n)` algorithm that, given a list of `n` elements, finds all the elements that appear more than `n/4` times.*
***
- Calculate `n/2`
- Keep track of the count for each element with a hash table, eliminate those that are not repeated at least `n/2` times.
- Same as before, but calculating `n/4`.
