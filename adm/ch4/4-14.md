*4.14 - Give an `O(n log k)` time algorithm that merges `k` sorted lists with a total of `n` elements into one sorted list. (Hint: use a heap to speed up the elementary `O(k n)` time algorithm).*
***
Use a binary search tree (heap) to store the final result array. Go through each sorted list and insert it into the heap. Insertion will be in `O(log n)` time.
