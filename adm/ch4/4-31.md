*4.31 - Suppose you are given an array `A` of `n` sorted numbers that has been circularly shifted `k` positions to the right. For example, `{35,42,5,15,27,29}` is a sorted array that has been circularly shifted `k=2` positions, while `{27,29,35,42,5,15}` has been shifted `k=4` positions.*
- *Suppose you know what `k` is. Give an `O(1)` algorithm to find the largest number in `A`.*
- *Suppose you do not know what `k` is. Give an `O(lg n)` algorithm to find the largest number in `A`. For partial credit, you may give an `O(n)` algorithm.*

```
find_largest(A, k) {
	return A[k-1]
}
```
```
find_largest(A) {
	large = A[0]
	for i=1; i<A.len();i++ {
		if A[i] > large {
			large = A[i]
		}
	}
	return large
}
