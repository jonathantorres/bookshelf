*4.19 - An inversion of a permutation is a pair of elements that are out of order.*
- *Show that a permutation of n items has at most n(n−1)/2 inversions. Which permutation(s) have exactly n(n−1)/2 inversions?*
- *Let `P` be a permutation and `P^r` be the reversal of this permutation. Show that `P` and `P^r` have a total of exactly `n(n−1)/2` inversions.*
- *Use the previous result to argue that the expected number of inversions in a random permutation is `n(n−1)/4`.*
***
- If all elements are out of order, then `n` has exactly `n(n-1)/2` inversions.
- If `P` contains `x` inversions, then it also contained `n(n-1)/2 - x` in order pairs.
- Any permutation of any set is likely to be equal.
