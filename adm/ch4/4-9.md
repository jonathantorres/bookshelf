*4.9 - Give an efficient algorithm to compute the union of sets `A` and `B`, where `n = max(|A|,|B|)`. The output should be an array of distinct elements that form the union of the sets, such that they appear exactly once in the union.*
- *Assume that `A` and `B` are unsorted. Give an `O(n log n)` algorithm for the problem.*
- *Assume that `A` and `B` are sorted. Give an `O(n)` algorithm for the problem*
***
- Sort the array `B`, go through each element in `A` and do a binary search on `B`, if found add that element to the output array.
- Loop through `A` and `B` at the same time, and check each element?
- Same as the first answer.
- Merge `A` and `B` and remove the duplicates.
