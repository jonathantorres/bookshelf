*4.17 - The median of a set of `n` values is the `⌈n/2⌉th` smallest value.*
- *Suppose quicksort always pivoted on the median of the current sub-array. How many comparisons would Quicksort make then in the worst case?*
- *Suppose quicksort were always to pivot on the `⌈n/3⌉th` smallest value of the current sub-array. How many comparisons would be made then in the worst case?*

- `O(n log n)` in the worst case
- `O(n log n)` in the worst case
