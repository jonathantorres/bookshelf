*4.20 - Give an efficient algorithm to rearrange an array of `n` keys so that all the negative keys precede all the nonnegative keys. Your algorithm must be in-place, meaning you cannot allocate another array to temporarily hold the items. How fast is your algorithm?*
***
- Quick sort will solve this on `O(n log n)` time.
- If you partition the array with 0 as the pivot, all negatives will be before the positives. This can be done in `O(n)` time.
