*4.1 - The Grinch is given the job of partitioning `2n` players into two teams of `n` players each. Each player has a numerical rating that measures how good he/she is at the game. He seeks to divide the players as unfairly as possible, so as to create the biggest possible talent imbalance between team `A` and team `B`. Show how the Grinch can do the job in `O(n log n)` time*
***
Use a `O(n log n)` sorting algorithm, use Heapsort, which will use the priority queue for the rating of each player. Put the top `n` players in team `A` and the bottom `n` players in team `B`.
