*4.18 - Suppose an array `A` consists of `n` elements, each of which is red, white, or blue. We seek to sort the elements so that all the reds come before all the whites, which come before all the blues The only operation permitted on the keys are:*
- *`Examine(A,i)` - report the color of the `ith` element of `A`.*
- *`Swap(A,i,j)` - swap the `ith` element of `A` with the `jth` element.*
*Find a correct and efficient algorithm for red-white-blue sorting. There is a linear-time solution.*
***
- Use the bucket sort solution, create 3 arrays (one for each color). Loop through `A` and add each color to it's appropriate array.
- This is known as the Dutch National Flag problem.
