*4.2 - For each of the following problems, give an algorithm that finds the desired numbers within the given amount of time. To keep your answers brief, feel free to use algorithms from the book as subroutines. For the example, `S={6,13,19,3,8}`, 19−3 maximizes the difference, while 8−6 minimizes the difference.*
- *Let `S` be an unsorted array of `n` integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair `x, y ∈ S` that maximizes `|x−y|`. Your algorithm must run in `O(n)` worst-case time.*
- *Let `S` be a sorted array of `n` integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair `x, y ∈ S` that maximizes `|x−y|`. Your algorithm must run in `O(1)` worst-case time.*
- *Let `S` be an unsorted array of `n` integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair `x, y ∈ S` that minimizes `|x−y|`, for `x≠y`. Your algorithm must run in `O(n log n)` worst-case time.*
- *Let `S` be a sorted array of `n` integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair `x, y ∈ S` that minimizes `|x−y|`, for `x≠y`. Your algorithm must run in `O(n)` worst-case time.*
***
- On each iteration, keep track of the largest number and the smallest number, substract the two at the end.
- Substract the last two numbers, since the numbers are already sorted.
- Sort the numbers using a `O(n log n)` algorithm, iterate through it and find the smallest gap.
- Iterate over the numbers and find the smallest gap, since they are already sorted.
