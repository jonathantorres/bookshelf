*4.16 - Use the partitioning idea of quicksort to give an algorithm that finds the median element of an array of `n` integers in expected `O(n)` time. (Hint: must you look at both sides of the partition?)*
***
- Calculate the middle element of the array `(n/2)`, if the array is sorted, just find the `(n/2)` element of it.
- Yes, you must look at both sides of the partition if it's not sorted.
- I think the best way to do this, is to sort the array first.
