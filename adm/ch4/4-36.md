*4.36 - Consider an `n x n` array `A` containing integer elements (positive, negative, and zero). Assume that the elements in each row of `A` are in strictly increasing order, and the elements of each column of `A` are in strictly decreasing order. (Hence there cannot be two zeroes in the same row or the same column.) Describe an efficient algorithm that counts the number of occurrences of the element `0` in `A`. Analyze its running time.
***
A slow algorithm would check every possible input by looping through the `n x n` array in `O(n^2)` time. A more efficient approach would take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted and check the first element on each row to see if it equals to zero. This would run in `O(n)` time.
