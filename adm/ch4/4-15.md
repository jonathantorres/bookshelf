*4.15 - (a) Give an efficient algorithm to find the second-largest key among `n` keys. You can do better than `2n - 3` comparisons. (b) Then, give an efficient algorithm to find the third-largest key among `n` keys. How many key comparisons does your algorithm do in the worst case? Must your algorithm determine which key is largest and second-largest in the process?*
***
- Use a sorted heap in descending order and call `get-max` twice.
- Same as the previous answer, but calling the function `get-max` 3 times.
