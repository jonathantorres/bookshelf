*4.34 - Suppose that you are given a sorted sequence of distinct integers `{a1,a2,â€¦,an}`, drawn from `1` to `m` where `n<m`. Give an `O(lg n)` algorithm to find an integer `<= m` that is not present in `a`. For full credit, find the smallest such integer.*
***
Using binary search, but finding the number that's not there. Starting with `m/2`
```
// test cases
L = [1,7,9,11,14] // 1 to 14, m = 14, n = 5
m = L[end]
not_in_a_result = not_in_a(L, m)

not_in_a(list, m) {
	mid_m = ceil(m/2)

	if bin_search(list, mid_m) != false {
		// try another number between (mid_m+1 and m)
		not_in_a(list, mid_m-1)
		// try another number between (1 and mid_m-1)
		not_in_a(list, mid_m+1)
	} else {
		return mid_m
	}
}
```
