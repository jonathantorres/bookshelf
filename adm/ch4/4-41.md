*4.41 - Describe advantages and disadvantages of the most popular sorting algorithms.*
***
- Quicksort (Advantages): Fast, `O(n log n)`
- Quicksort (Disadvantages): Worst case is `O(n^2)` but inlikely
- Merge Sort (Advantages): Fast `O(n log n)`
- Merge Sort (Disadvantages): Not stable, takes a lot of memory space when merging
- Bubble Sort (Advantages): None
- Bubble Sort (Disadvantages): Slow! `O(n^2)`
- Insertion Sort (Advantages): None
- Insertion Sort (Disadvantages): Slow! `O(n^2)`
- Selection Sort (Advantages): None
- Selection Sort (Disadvantages): Slow! `O(n^2)`
- Heapsort (Advantages): Fast and useful `O(n log n)`
- Heapsort (Disadvantages): Works on specific data structures. A better data structure must be made in order to be effective
