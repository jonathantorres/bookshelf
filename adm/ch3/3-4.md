*3.4 - Design a dictionary data structure in which search, insertion, and deletion can all be processed in `O(1)` time in the worst case. You may assume the set elements are integers drawn from a finite set `1, 2, .., n`, and initialization can take `O(n)` time.*  
***
- Using an unsorted array, this way insertion can always be at position `n`. `Insert(D, value);`
- On every insertion, track the length of the dictionary.
- For deletion, the index of the item to be deleted should be provided `Delete(D, index);`
- For searching use a pointer to the address of the element to be found `Search(D, p);`
