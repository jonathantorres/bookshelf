*3.14 - Extend the data structure of the previous problem to support insertions and deletions. Each element now has both a key and a value. An element is accessed by its key. The addition operation is applied to the values, but the elements are accessed by its key. The Partial sum operation is different.*
- *`Add(k,y)` - Add the value y to the item with key `k`.*
- *`Insert(k,y)` - Insert a new item with key `k` and value `y`.*
- *`Delete(k)` - Delete the item with key `k`.*
- *`Partial-sum(k)` - Return the sum of all the elements currently in the set whose key is less than `y`*
The worst case running time should still be `O(n log n)` for any sequence of `O(n)` operations.
***
- A hash table should be appropriate for this.
- For the `Add(k, y)` function we use the index to find the appropriate value and add the value to it there. This would run in `O(1)`.
- For `Insert(k,y)` we can use the hashing function to generate an index for us, and insert the element on the index that was generated, this would run in `O(1)`.
- `Delete(k)` would work the same as `Add(k, y)` where we just delete the element at that specific index. This would run in `O(1)`.
- `Partial-sum(k)` is trickier, we'll have to search for all those elements that are less than `k` and add them up. This will take `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements that are less than `k`.
- Also a balanced binary search tree would be appropriate. Perhaps even better.
