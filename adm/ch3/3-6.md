*3.6 - Describe how to modify any balanced tree data structure such that search, insert, delete, minimum, and maximum still take `O(log(n))` time each, but successor and predecessor now take `O(1)` time each. Which operations have to be modified to support this?*  
***
In the functions to insert and delete an element in the tree, do a procedure which tries it's best to adjust or balance the tree. To keep it's maximum height as logarithmic as possible.
