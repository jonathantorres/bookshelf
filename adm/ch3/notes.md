## Chapter 3 - Notes
- Dynamic memory allocation provides us with flexibility on how and where we use our limited storage resources.
- Data structure design must balance all the different operations it supports. The fastest data structure to support both operations `A` and `B` may well not be the fastest structure to support either operation `A` or `B`.
- Picking the wrong data structure for the job can be disastrous in terms of performance. Identifying the very best data structure is usually not as critical, because there can be several choices that perform similarly.
- Building algorithms around data structures such as dictionaries and priority queues leads to both clean structure and good performance.
