*3.10 - In the `bin-packing problem`, we are given `n` metal objects, each weighing between zero and one kilogram. Our goal is to find the smallest number of bins that will hold the `n` objects, with each bin holding one kilogram at most.*
- *The `best-fit heuristic` for bin packing is as follows. Consider the objects in the order in which they are given. For each object, place it into the partially filled bin with the smallest amount of extra room after the object is inserted. If no such bin exists, start a new bin. Design an algorithm that implements the best-fit heuristic (taking as input the `n` weights `w1,w2,...,wn` and outputting the number of bins used) in `O(n log(n))` time.*
- *Repeat the above using the worst-fit heuristic, where we put the next object in the partially filled bin with the largest amount of extra room after the object is inserted.*

```
bin_packing(weights) {
    if weights.len() == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    bins_created = 1
    cur_bin = create_bin()
    foreach weights as w {
        if (!add_to_bin(cur_bin, w)) {
            cur_bin = create_bin()
            bins_created++
        }
    }
    return bins_created
}
