*3.3 - We have seen how dynamic arrays enable arrays to grow while still achieving constant-time amortized performance. This problem concerns extending dynamic arrays to let them both grow and shrink on demand.*

- *Consider an underflow strategy that cuts the array size in half whenever the array falls below half full. Give an example sequence of insertions and deletions where this strategy gives a bad amortized cost.*
- *Then, give a better underflow strategy than that suggested above, one that achieves constant amortized cost per deletion.*  
***
- Array of size 4, with 3 elements, remove 1 and insert 1 and so on.
- When the array is one-fourth full, shrink it's size to half of what it was.
