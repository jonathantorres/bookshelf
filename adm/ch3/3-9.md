*3.9 - A concatenate operation takes two sets `S1` and `S2`, where every key in `S1` is smaller than any key in `S2`, and merges them together. Give an algorithm to concatenate two binary search trees into one binary search tree. The worst-case running time should be `O(h)`, where `h` is the maximal height of the two trees.*
***
Since all the elements in `S2` have keys larger than the keys of the elements in `S1`, those two trees can be subtrees of one tree whose root node will have a key larger than the largest key in `S1` and smaller than the smallest key in `S2`.  

Then `S2` will be the right subtree and `S1` the left subtree.  

The easiest way to do this is to find the minimum element of `S2` (or the maximum of `S1`) and put it as the root of the concatenated tree and then update its left and right pointer to point to the root of `S1` and `S2` respectively. The worst-case running time will be `O(h)`, which is the time of retrieving the minimum (maximum) element of a tree.
