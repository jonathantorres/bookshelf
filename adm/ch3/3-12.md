*3.12 - Suppose you are given an input set `S` of `n` numbers, and a black box that if
given any sequence of real numbers and an integer `k` instantly and correctly answers
whether there is a subset of input sequence whose sum is exactly `k`. Show how to
use the black box `O(n)` times to find a subset of `S` that adds up to `k`.*
***
```
S = [3,5,7,2,4]
R = S
k = 4
for i=0; i < S.len()-1; i++ {
	set = S[i] to S[S.len()-1]
	if (black_box(set, k)) {
		R = set
		break
	}
}
```
