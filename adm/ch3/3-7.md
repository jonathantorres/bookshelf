*3.7 - Suppose you have access to a balanced dictionary data structure, which supports each of the operations search, insert, delete, minimum, maximum, successor, and predecessor in `O(log n)` time. Explain how to modify the insert and delete operations so they still take `O(log n)` but now minimum and maximum take `O(1)` time. (Hint: think in terms of using the abstract dictionary operations, instead of mucking about with pointers and the like.)*  
***
- Keep track of the minimum and maximum value in the tree on each insert and delete.
- Call the `successor` and `predeccessor` functions on each insert and delete that would update these values.
