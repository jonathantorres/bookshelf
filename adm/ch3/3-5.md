*3.5 - Find the overhead fraction (the ratio of data space over total space) for each of the following binary tree implementations on `n` nodes:*  
- *All nodes store data, two child pointers, and a parent pointer. The data field requires four bytes and each pointer requires four bytes.*
- *Only leaf nodes store data; internal nodes store two child pointers. The data field requires four bytes and each pointer requires two bytes.*
***
- If the tree has 3 nodes, then each node has a total of 16 bytes for a total of 48 bytes. Divide that by the amount of bytes in memory?
- If the tree has 4 nodes, which 2 of them are leafs, then:
```
4 bytes * 2 + 8 bytes * 2
8 + 16
24 bytes in total
```
Divide 24 by the amount of bytes in memory?
