*3.29 - Give an algorithm for finding an ordered word pair (e.g., New York) occurring with the greatest frequency in a given webpage. Which data structures would you use? Optimize both time and space.*

```
occurences = {}; // dictionary or associative array
for i=0; i < words_in_doc.length; i++ {
    if is_uppercase(first_letter(words_in_doc[i])) 
       && is_uppercase(first_letter(words_in_doc[i+1])) {
        full_word = words_in_doc[i] + ' ' + words_in_doc[i+1]
        if dic_key_exists(occurences, full_word) {
            occurences[full_word] += 1;
        } else {
            occurences[full_word] = 1;
        }
    }
}
```
- A hash table would be a good option, to store the occurrences. For example: use the words as the key and the number of repeats as the value ("New York -> 6"). If the word "New York" is repeated 6 times.
