*3.11 - Suppose that we are given a sequence of `n` values `x1, x2, ..., xn` and seek to quickly answer repeated queries of the form: given `i` and `j`, find the smallest value in `xi,...,xj` .*
- *Design a data structure that uses `O(n^2)` space and answers queries in `O(1)` time.*
- *Design a data structure that uses `O(n)` space and answers queries in `O(log n)` time. For partial credit, your data structure can use `O(n log n)` space and have `O(log n)` query time.*
***
- Use a binary search tree, to get the smallest value implement a `Minimum(T, x)` function that should return the minimum value.
- Use a sorted array, and use binary search to answer for a query.
