*3.15 - Design a data structure that allows one to search, insert, and delete an integer `X` in `O(1)` time (i.e., constant time, independent of the total number of integers stored). Assume that `1 <= X <= n` and that there are `m+n` units of space available, where `m` is the maximum number of integers that can be in the table at any one time. (Hint: use two arrays `A[1..n]` and `B[1..m]`.) You are not allowed to initialize either `A` or `B`, as that would take `O(m)` or `O(n)` operations. This means the arrays are full of random garbage to begin with, so you must be very careful.*
***

- A hash table composed of an array of arrays can be used, in which insertions and deletions will be `O(1)`
- If the bucket array is kept sorted then search can be `O(log n)` after using the hashing function to find the index in `O(1)`.
