*7.13 - Design and implement an algorithm for solving the set cover problem discussed in Section 18.1 (page 621).*
***
- Greedy is the most natural and effective heuristic for set cover.
- Select the largest subset for the cover, and then delete all it's elements from the universal set.
- Add the subset containing the largest number of remaining uncovered elements repeatedly until all are covered.
- This heuristic always gives a set cover using at most `ln n` times as many sets as optimal.
