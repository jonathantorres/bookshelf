*7.12 - Design and implement an algorithm for solving the minimum feedback vertex set problem discussed in Section 16.11 (page 559)*
***
- Use BFS to identify the shortest cycle in `G`.
- Delete all the vertices in the cycle from `G` and the shortest remaining cycle identified.
- Employ this find-and-delete procedure until the graph is acyclic.
