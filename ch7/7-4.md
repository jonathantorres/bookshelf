*7.4 - Anagrams are rearrangements of the letters of a word or phrase into a different word or phrase. Sometimes the results are quite striking. For example, "MANY VOTED BUSH RETIRED" is an anagram of "TUESDAY NOVEMBER THIRD" which correctly predicted the result of the 1992 U.S. presidential election. Design and implement an algorithm for finding anagrams using combinatorial search and a dictionary.*
