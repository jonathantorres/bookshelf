*7.1 - A derangement is a permutation `p` of `{1,...,n}` such that no item is in its proper position, i.e. `p[i] != i`for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. Write an efficient backtracking program with pruning that constructs all the derangements of `n` items.*
***
If `a` is an input array and `curr`, the derangement built thus far:
- If `curr` is a solution, print it.
- Otherwise, examine all the possibilities for the next element of the derangement. The next element must come from `a`.
- It must not already have been used so far
- And it most not be the element at the same position in the input array.
- For each remaining posibility, add it to the current derangement and recurse.
