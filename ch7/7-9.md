*7.9 - Design and implement an algorithm for solving the maximum clique problem discussed in Section 16.1 (page 525)*
***
- Best solution is an exhaustive search via backtracking.
- Search through all `k` subsets of the vertices, pruning a subset as soon as it contains a vertex that is not adjacent to all the rest.
- The upper bound on the maximum clique in `G` is the highest vertex degree plus 1.
- A better upper bound comes from sorting the vertices in order of decreasing degree.
- Let `j` be the largest index such that degree of the `j`th vertex is at least `j-1`.
- The largest clique in the graph contains no more than `j` vertices, since no vertex of degree `< (j-1)` can appear in a clique of size `j`.
