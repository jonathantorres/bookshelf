## Scheduling: Introduction (Answers)
1. Response time for SJF: `200`, Turnaround time for SJF: `400`, Response Time for FIFO: `200`, Turnaround time for FIFO: `400`

2. Response time for SJF: `133.33`, Turnaround time for SJF: `333.33`, Response Time for FIFO: `133.33`, Turnaround time for FIFO: `333.33`

3. Response time for RR: `1.00`, Turnaround time for RR: `465.67`

4. For jobs that have the same length

5. Round Robin has a significant faster response time, I think the only time were they would be identical or similar is when the quantum time of the RR is pretty large.

6. The response time grows as the length of the jobs increase.

7. The response time will grow.
