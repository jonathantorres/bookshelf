### Exercise 6.4

Most systems represent `time_t` as a signed integer, after we calculate the latest time and it wraps around, the date will be set to the smallest date that can be represented with that number.

If `time_t` is represented as a 32-bit integer, it's latest time is 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038, once it wraps around it will be set to 20:45:52 UTC on 13 December 1901.
