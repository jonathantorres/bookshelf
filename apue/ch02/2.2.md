### Exercise 2.2

Listing of the ones that I could find, I bet that most of them are implemented with the standard types (`int`, `long int` etc. etc.):

| Type               | Actual Type     |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| `caddr_t`          | `char *`        |
| `sig_atomic_t`     | `int`           |
