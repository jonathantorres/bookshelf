## 21. Beyond Physical Memory: Mechanisms (Answers)

1. The output makes sense, the amount of memory used is displayed

2. The amount of free'd memory reduces significantly while running the mem program, it goes back to a similar value that it was before once the program is stopped

3. The numbers of swapped memory changed from 0 to a few thousand, running the activity monitor, it reports that about 500MB of memory swap was used

4. They increase significantly as more memory from the program is allocated

5. The first loop starts after 5 seconds, the increase of time varies per loop after that, I'll say around 1 second on average per each loop

6. Memory allocation fails once I allocate anything higher than 7GB

7. Configure the system appropriately for this exercise
