## 10. Multiprocessor Scheduling (Advanced) (Answers)

1. The job finishes in 30

2. The job finishes in time 20

3. The value on the second column decreases by 1 in the first CPU and by two on the second CPU

4. The cache becomes warm as the job is moved to the second CPU. It warms later if the value is set to a higher number and viceversa

5. The jobs will be finished in time 150. Caches are warmed right away

6. It's significantly faster, it finishes more jobs in 110 time. Moving jobs to other CPUs seems to make it slower (it takes about 200 and 300 time on these cases)

7. The larger cache size seem to be more faster if used with more CPU's, it makes a difference when using 3 CPU's or more

8. The higher the peak interval, the higher the performance it seems

9. Play around with the command and the options
