*8.25 - You are given an array of `n` numbers, each of which may be positive, negative, or zero. Give an efficient algorithm to identify the index positions `i` and `j` to the maximum sum of the `ith` through `jth` numbers.*
***
- This is a special case of the maximum contiguos sum problem
- Instead of computing the result for 0,n instead we compute for i,j. We return 3 values indicating the index positions `i',j'` and max for the maximum sum of the `ith` through `jth` numbers. Worst case is `O(n)`.
