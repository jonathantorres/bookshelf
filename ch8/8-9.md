*8.9 - The knapsack problem is as follows: given a set of integers `S={s1,s2,...,sn}`, and a given target number `T`, find a subset of `S` that adds up exactly to `T`. For example, within `S={1,2,5,9,10}` there is a subset that adds up to `T=22` but not `T=23`.*

*Give a correct programming algorithm for knapsack that runs in `O(nT)`time*
***
Use a greedy algorithm. Loop through the integers in `S` always picking the biggest one. Maybe sort them first. Pick the largest one and keep adding the total until it matchs `T`. If it goes over `T` then a subset cannot be found.
