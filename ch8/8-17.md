*8.17 - Consider the same situation as the previous problem. We have a city whose streets are defined by an `X×Y` grid. We are interested in walking from the upper left-hand corner of the grid to the lower right-hand corner. We are given an `X×Y` matrix `BAD`, where `BAD[i,j] = “yes”` if and only if the intersection between streets `i` and `j` is somewhere we want to avoid.*

*If there were no bad neighborhoods to contend with, the shortest path across the grid would have length `(X−1) + (Y−1)` blocks, and indeed there would be many such paths across the grid. Each path would consist of only rightward and downward moves.*

*Give an algorithm that takes the array `BAD` and returns the number of safe paths of length `X+Y−2`. For full credit, your algorithm must run in `O(XY)`*

- Using this matrix:

|   |   |   |   |   |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| G | G | G | G | G |
| G | G | B | G | G |
| G | B | G | B | G |
| G | G | G | G | G |

|   |   |   |   |   |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 1 | 2 | X | 4 | 5 |
| 2 | X | 6 | X | 6 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

- We start with costs `0` at `[0,0]` therefore we got `X+Y-2-1` as the shortest path. We have to count how often the full set exists.
