*8.21 - Given an array of `n` real numbers, consider the problem of finding the maximum sum in any contiguous subvector of the input. For example, in the array `{31,−41,59,26,−53,58,97,−93,−23,84}` the maximum is achieved by summing the third through seventh elements, where `59 + 26 + (−53) + 58 + 97 = 187`. When all numbers are positive, the entire array is the answer, while when all numbers are negative, the empty array maximizes the total at `0`*
- *Give a simple, clear, and correct `Θ(n^2)` time algorithm to find the maximum contiguous subvector.*
- *Now give a `Θ(n)` time dynamic programming algorithm for this problem. To get partial credit, you may instead give a correct `O(n log n)` divide-and-conquer algorithm.*
***
- Sum every positive range and keep track of the maximum range.
- Use a DP matrix to prevent you from calculating the sum of the same range more than once.
