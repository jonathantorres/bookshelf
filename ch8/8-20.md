*8.20 - We wish to compute the laziest way to dial given `n` digit number on a standard push-button telephone using two fingers. We assume that the two fingers startout on the * and # keys, and that the effort required to move a finger from one button to another is proportional to the Euclidean distance between them. Design an algorithm that computes the method of dialing that involves moving your fingers the smallest amount of total distance, where `k` is the number of distinct keys on the keypad (`k=16` for standard telephones). Try to use `O(nk^3)` time.*
***
Use the right finger (on #) to dial the numbers on the right (3,6,9) and just two numbers from the middle column (2,5). Use the left finger (on * ) to dial the numbers on the leftmost column (1,4,7) and the other two numbers of the middle row (8,0). Keep a DP matrix to avoid calculating the same distance more than once.
