*8.10 - The integer partition takes a set of positive integers `S=s1,...,s[n]` and asks if there is a subset `I ∈ S`such that:*

*Let `∑i ∈ S s[i]=M`. Give an `O(nM)` dynamic programming algorithm to solve the integer partition problem.*
***
This is a variation of the knapsack problem. Each partition should be half of `∑S[i]` we just search for this value as `T` and check if the rest of `S` is equal to this too. This should run in `O(nm)` time.
