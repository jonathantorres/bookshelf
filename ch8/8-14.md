*8.14 - The traditional world chess championship is a match of 24 games. The current champion retains the title in case the match is a tie. Each game ends in a win, loss, or draw (tie) where wins count as 1, losses as 0, and draws as 1/2. The players take turns playing white and black. White has an advantage, because he moves first. The champion plays white in the first game. He has probabilities `ww`, `wd`, and `wl` of winning, drawing, and losing playing white, and has probabilities `bw`, `bd`, and `bl` of winning, drawing, and losing playing black.*
- *Write a recurrence for the probability that the champion retains the title. Assume that there are `g` games left to play in the match and that the champion needs to win `i` games (which may end in a 1/2).*
- *Based on your recurrence, give a dynamic programming to calculate the champion's probability of retaining the title.*
- *Analyze its running time for an `n` game match*
***
Assuming there are 5 games left to play and the champion is up 10-9. The champion would need to win at least the next 2 games to retain the tittle, as long as one of the games is a tie and not a lost game.
