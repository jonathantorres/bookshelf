*8.13 - Consider the following data compression technique. We have a table of `m` text strings, each at most `k` in length. We want to encode a data string `D` of length `n` using as few text strings as possible. For example, if our table contains `(a,ba,abab,b)` and the data string is `bababbaababa`, the best way to encode it is `(b,abab,ba,abab,a)` a total of five code words. Give an `O(nmk)` algorithm to find the length of the best encoding. You may assume that every string has at least one encoding in terms of the table.*

Use a typical DP approach where we use memoization to save and generate substrings. We try every permutation, eventually we will get the correct solution.
