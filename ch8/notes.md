## Chapter 8 - Notes
- Explicit caching of the results of recursive calls provides most of the benefits of dynamic programming, including usually the same running time as the more elegant full solution. If you prefer doing extra programming to more subtle thinking, you can stop here.
- Once you understand dynamic programming, it can be easier to work out such algorithms from scratch than to try to look them up.
- For any optimization problem on left-to-right objects, such as characters in a string, elements of a permutation, points around a polygon, or leaves in a search tree, dynamic programming likely leads to an efficient algorithm to find the optimal solution.
- Without an inherent left-to-right ordering of the objects, dynamic programming is usually doomed to require exponential space and time.
- The global optimum (found for example, using dynamic programming) is often noticeably better than the solution found by typical heuristics. How important this improvement is depends on your application, but it can never hurt.
