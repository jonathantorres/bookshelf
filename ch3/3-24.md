*3.24 - What is the best data structure for maintaining URLs that have been visited by a Web crawler? Give an algorithm to test whether a given URL has already been visited, optimizing both space and time. *
***
- A trie or a ternary search tree. Use the trie to do a search if the given url is already there, I think it should take `O(log(h))` time.
- A linked list is also an option, but the search would be a lot slower with it, `O(n)`.
