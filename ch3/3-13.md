*3.13 - Let `A[1..n]` be an array of real numbers. Design an algorithm to perform any sequence of the following operations:*
- *`Add(i,y)` - Add the value `y` to the `i`th number.*
- *`Partial-sum(i)` - Return the sum of the first `i` numbers*
*There are no insertions or deletions, the only change is to the values of the numbers. Each operation should take `O(log n)` steps. You may use one additional array of size `n` as a work space.*
***
- The `Add(i,y)` function should take `O(1)` since we can access the specified index `i` in the array and add the number there.
- For `Partial-sum(i)` we have to go through all of the numbers, and add them up. This would take `O(n)`. `n` being the number of numbers we want to sum.
