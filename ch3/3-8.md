*3.8 - Design a data structure to support the following operations:*
- *`insert(x,T)` - Insert item `x` into the set `T`.*
- *`delete(k,T)` - Delete the `k`th smallest element from `T`.*
- *`member(x,T)` - Return true if `x epsilon T`.*
*All operations must take `O(log(n))` time on an `n`-element set.*
***
- Use a binary search tree.
- Implement a search function with binary search, this should take `O(log(n))` time.
- When inserting, it will always be sorted.
- When deleting, we would search for what we want to delete, which takes `O(log(n))` and then delete it.
- When checking if a member is `x epsilon T` we woulg have to search with binary search which takes `O(log(n))` and do the check then.
