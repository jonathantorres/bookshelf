*3.28 - You have an unordered array `X` of `n` integers. Find the array `M` containing `n` elements where `M[i]` is the product of all integers in `X` except for `X[i]`. You may not use division. You can use extra memory. (Hint: There are solutions faster than `O(n^2)`.)*
***
```
i = 0
j = 0
for num in X {
	prod = 1
	for num2 in X {
		if i == j {
			continue
		}
		prod *= num2
		j++
	}
	M[i] = prod
	i++
}
```
