#### R1
Is when the hosts are associated with a base station. It's an adhoc network, this is where the hosts themselves provide for services such as routing, address assignment, DNS-like name translation etc. etc.

#### R2
MANET has nodes that are also mobile, but if the mobile nodes are also vehicles then those are VANET

#### R3
Path loss happends when a signal passes through a wall or other matter. Interference is different radio sources transmitting in the same frecuency band and multipath propagation is when portions of the electromagnetic wave reflect of objects and the ground

#### R4
To try to be able to communicate/send data to the node, to keep the node connected as much as possible, this would require more power though

#### R5
They permit nearby wireless stations to discover and identify the AP

#### R6
It contains the AP's SSID and MAC address

#### R7
Since it's a wireless LAN, the frame may not reach the destination station intact for a variety of reasons

#### R8
Passive scanning scans for channels and listens for beacon frames, active scanning broadcasts a probe frame that will be received by all AP's within the wireless host's range

#### R9
It gives the sender explicit permission to send and also instructs the other stations not to send for the reserved duration

#### R10
No, there wouldn't be any advantage, since the RTS/CTS exchange is only useful when the RTS/CTS frames are significantly smaller than the DATA frames

#### R11
The switch has an entry in it's forwarding table, which associates the station with the earlier AP. When the wireless station associates with the new AP, the new AP creates a frame with the wireless station's MAC address and broadcasts the frame

#### R12
- Bluetooth: 4Mbps
- Zigbee: 1Mbps

#### R13
A frame of beacon frames divided into time periods to conserve power

#### R14
- Evolved Packet Core (EPC)
- LTE Radio Access Network

#### R15
It controls several cell base receiver stations similar to the base stations that are encountered in 2G systems

#### R16
No, a node can remain connected to the same access point throughout it's connection to the Internet

#### R17
A permanent address is it's IP address when it is at it's home network. A care-of-address is the one it gets when it is visiting a foreign network. The COA is assigned by the foreign agent

#### R18
False

#### R19
In GSM the home network maintains a database called the home location register (HLR), it contains the permanent cell phone number and subscriber profile about each subscriber. The visited network also maintains a database known as the visitor location register (VLR) and contains an entry for each mobile use that is currently in the portion of the network server by the VLR

#### R20
Is the MSC visited by the mobile host when a call first begins, the anchor MSC remain unchanged during the call

#### R21
- Local recovery
- TCP sender awareness of wireless links
- Split-connection approaches
