## Chapter 6 - Notes
- Most applications of graphs can be reduced to standard graph properties where well-known algorithms can be used. These include minimum spanning trees, shortest paths, and other problems presented in the catalog.
- The maximum flow from `s` to `t` always equals the weight of  the minimum `s-t` cut. Thus, flow algorithms can be used to solve general edge and vertex connectivity problems in graphs.
- Designing novel graphs algorithms is very hard, so don't do it. Instead, try to design graphs that enable you to use classical algorithms to model your problem.
