*6.18 - In certain graph problems, vertices have can have weights instead of or in addition to the weights of edges. Let `Cv` be the cost of vertex `v`, and `C(x,y)` the cost of the edge `(x, y)`. This problem is concerned with finding the cheapest path between vertices `a` and `b` in a graph `G`. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges and vertices encountered on the path.*
- *a) Suppose that each edge in the graph has a weight of zero (while non-edges have a cost of `Infinity`). Assume that `Cv= 1` for all vertices `1 ≤ v ≤ n` (i.e. , all vertices have the same cost). Give an efficient algorithm to find the cheapest path from `a` to `b` and its time complexity.*
- *b) Now suppose that the vertex costs are not constant (but are all positive) and the edge costs remain as above. Give an efficient algorithm to find the cheapest path from `a` to `b` and its time complexity.*
- *c) Now suppose that both the edge and vertex costs are not constant (but are all positive). Give an efficient algorithm to find the cheapest path from `a` to `b` and its time complexity.*

I feel like all three problems can be solved using the principles of Dijkstra's algorithm. All three problems could be solved in `O(n^2)`. In the problem of (c) we'll have to add the vertices and the edges together. This technique is described on page 209 of the book.
