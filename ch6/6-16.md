*6.16 - Answer all of the following:*
- *a) Give an example of a weighted connected graph `G=(V, E)` and a vertex `v`, such that the minimum spanning tree of `G` is the same as the shortest-path spanning tree rooted at `v`.*
- *b) Give an example of a weighted connected directed graph `G=(V, E)` and a vertex `v`, such that the minimum-cost spanning tree of `G` is very different from the shortest-path spanning tree rooted at `v`*
- *c) Can the two trees be completely disjointed?*
