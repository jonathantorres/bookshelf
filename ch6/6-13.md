*6.13 - Design a data structure that can perform a sequence of, `m` union and `find` operations on a universal set of `n` elements, consisting of a sequence of all unions followed by a sequence of all finds, in time `O(m+n)`.*
***
- This problem can be reduced to finding connected components in a graph.
- We can use union-set provided by the book. Modify the find function replacing it by path compression, splitting, or halving. Using both this and union by size make find and union run in (amortized) constant time.
- Initializing the union-set is `O(n)`, and running `m` union and finds are `O(2m)`. Thus, the total running time is `O(n+m)`
