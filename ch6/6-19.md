*6.19 - Let `G` be a weighted directed graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, where all edges have positive weight. A directed cycle is a directed path that starts and ends at the same vertex and contains at least one edge. Give an `O(n^3)` algorithm to find a directed cycle in `G` of minimum total weight. Partial credit will be given for an `O(n^2 m)` algorithm.*
***
This can be solved by applying an All Pairs Shortest Path (an adjacency matrix is needed for this algorithm), Floyd-Warshall algorithm for directed graphs. This will run in `O(n^3)` time.
