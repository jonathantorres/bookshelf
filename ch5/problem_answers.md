#### P2
Double bit error:
- 0000
- 1001
- 0101
- 1010

#### P3
The sum would be: 10100010 00001100

#### P4
- 00011001 00011110
- 10011111 10100100
- 00000000 00000001

#### P5
R = 0100

#### P6
- R = 0101
- R = 0001
- R = 0010

#### P7
- If D contains at least two 1's, then a single bit error can always be detected
- No, since a sequence of odd-number bit errors cannot be divided by 11, so it cannot be divided by G

#### P8
- E(p) = O -> p * = 1/N
- lim E(p * ) = 1/e

#### P9
lim E(p * ) = 1/2 * 1/e = 1/2e

#### P10
- A's average throughput is pA(1-pB). Total efficiency is pA(1-pB) + pB(1-pA)
- A's throughput is pA(1-pB) = 2pB(1-pB) = 2pB - 2(pB)2
- B's throughput is pB(1-pA) = pB(1-2pB) = pB - 2(pB)2
- A's throughput is 2p(1-p)N-1

#### P11
- (1-p(A)) 4p(A)
- p(A succeeds in slot 4) = p(1-p)3
- p(B succeeds in slot 4) = p(1-p)3
- p(C succeeds in slot 4) = p(1-p)3
- p(D succeeds in slot 4) = p(1-p)3
- p(some node succeds in a slot) = 4p(1-p)3
- p(no node succeds in a slot) = 1-4p(1-p)3
- efficiency = p(success in a slot) = 4p(1-p)3
