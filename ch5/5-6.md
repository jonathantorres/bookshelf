*5.6 - In breadth-first and depth-first search, an undiscovered node is marked discovered when it is first encountered, and marked processed when it has been completely searched. At any given moment, several nodes might be simultaneously in the discovered state.*  
*(a) Describe a graph on `n` vertices and a particular starting vertex `v` such that `Θ(n)` nodes are simultaneously in the discovered state during a breadth-first search starting from `v`.  
(b) Describe a graph on `n` vertices and a particular starting vertex `v` such that `Θ(n)` nodes are simultaneously in the discovered state during a depth-first search starting from `v`.  
(c) Describe a graph on `n` vertices and a particular starting vertex `v` such that at some point `Θ(n)`nodes remain undiscovered, while `Θ(n)` nodes have been processed during a depth-first search starting from `v`. (Note, there may also be discovered nodes.)*
***
- When breadth-first search has started on the graph (but not completed) an specified amount of nodes are discovered at this point.
- Same as with breadth-first search, when the depth-first search has started but not completed a specific amount of nodes are discovered at that point.
- Going walf way through the search for `n/2` nodes that are discovered, there can be `n/2` nodes that are undiscovered.
