*5.20 - Given an undirected graph `G` with `n` vertices and `m` edges, and an integer `k`, give an `O(m+n)` algorithm that finds the maximum induced subgraph `H` of `G` such that each vertex in `H` has degree `â‰¥k`, or prove that no such graph exists. An induced subgraph `F=(U, R)` of a graph `G=(V, E)` is a subset of `U` of the vertices `V` of `G`, and all edges `R` of `G` such that both vertices of each edge are in `U`.*
***
Traverse the graph, maybe with BFS or DFS and construct the new graph based on the data for each vertex.
