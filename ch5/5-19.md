*5.19 - The diameter of a tree `T=(V, E)`is given by `max δ(u, v) u,v ∈ V` (where `δ(u, v)` is the number of edges on the path from `u` to `v`). Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the diameter of a tree, and show the correctness and analyzethe running time of your algorithm.*
***
Traverse the tree from `u` to `v` and count the number of edges. This would run on `O(h)` in the worst case. `h` being the height of the tree.
