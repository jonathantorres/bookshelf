*5.15 - A vertex cover of a graph `G=(V, E)` is a subset of vertices `V′ ∈ V` such that every edge in `E` contains at least one vertex from `V′`. An independent set of graph `G=(V, E)` is a subset of vertices `V′ ∈ V` such that no edge in `E` contains both vertices from `V′`. An independent vertex cover is a subset of vertices that is both an independent set and a vertex cover of `G`. Give an efficient algorithm for testing whether `G` contains an independent vertex cover. What classical graph problem does this reduce to?*  
***
- To build a vertex cover, we need to keep at least one vertex for each edge. The independent set requires at most one vertex for each edge.
- Together it means we need to keep only exactly one vertex for each edge, this reduces to a two-colour graph problem. 
- This problem is efficiently handled by breadth-first search.
