*5.13 - A vertex cover of a graph `G=(V, E)` is a subset of vertices `V′` such that each edge in `E` is incident on at least one vertex of `V′`.*  
*- Give an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-size vertex cover if `G` is a tree*  
*- Let `G=(V, E)` be a tree such that the weight of each vertex is equal to the degree of that vertex. Give an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-weight vertex cover of `G`.*  
*- Let `G=(V, E)` be a tree with arbitrary weights associated with the vertices. Give an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-weight vertex cover of `G`.*
***
- We can determine that leafs should never be included into the cover.
- Choose between removing the `n` children of degree one or the parent of degree `n+1`.
- Use a two-coloring technique (red-black) and perform a post order traversal.
