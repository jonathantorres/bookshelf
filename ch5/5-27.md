*5.27 - A tournament is a directed graph formed by taking the complete undirected graph and assigning arbitrary directions on the edges i.e, a graph `G=(V, E)` such that for all `u,v âˆˆ V`, exactly one of `(u, v)` or `(v, u)` is in `E`. Show that every tournament has a Hamiltonian path that is, a path that visits every vertex exactly once. Give an algorithm to find this path.*

Proof by induction:  
- A tournament with 2 vertices `(1,2)` has a Hamiltonian path. 1->2 or vice versa 
- Now suppose our tournament with `n` vertices has a Hamiltonian path `1,..,n`. Now add a vertex `(n+1)` that is connected to every other node. 3 cases may occur:
- Case 1: If the first node of the `n` Hamiltonian path can be reached by vertex `(n+1)`, add `(n+1)` to the beginning of the path. New Hamiltonian path: `n+1,1,...,n`
- Case 2: If the last node of the `n` Hamiltonian path can reach the vertex `(n+1)`, add `(n+1)` to the end of the path. New Hamiltonian path: `1,...,n,n+1`
- Case 3: Take the first node of the `n` Hamiltonian path that can be reached by `(n+1)`. This must exist, because we are not in case 2. Call this node `k`. By definition of this node, `(k-1)` can reach `(n+1)`. Form the new Hamiltonian path as: `1,...,k-1,n+1,k,...,n`.
