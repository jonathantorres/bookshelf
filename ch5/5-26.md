*5.26 - A mother vertex in a directed graph `G=(V, E)` is a vertex `v` such that all other vertices `G` can be reached by a directed path from `v`.*  
*- Give an `O(n+m)` algorithm to test whether a given vertex `v` is a mother of `G`, where `n=|V|` and `m=|E|`*  
*- Give an `O(n+m)` algorithm to test whether graph `G` contains a mother vertex.*  
***
Use BFS or DFS on each vertex to find out if vertex `n` is a mother vertex.
