*5.28 - An articulation vertex of a graph `G` is a vertex whose deletion disconnects `G`. Let `G` be a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges. Give a simple `O(n+m)` algorithm for finding a vertex of `G` that is not an articulation vertex, whose deletion does not disconnect `G`*  
***
- We know that the root of the DFS/BFS tree (with two or more children) of the graph is an articulation vertex.
- Go through each vertex and edge using DFS or BFS, any leaf in the resulting DFS/BFS tree, is not an articulation vertex.
