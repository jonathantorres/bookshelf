*5.7 - Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, is it possible to reconstruct the tree? If so, sketch an algorithm to do it. If not, give a counter example. Repeat the problem if you are given the pre-order and post-order traversals.*
***
Yes, it's possible, You can loop through the tree and make a copy of it, and destroy the original one after we are done.
