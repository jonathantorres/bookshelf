*5.17 - Consider the problem of determining whether a given undirected graph `G=(V, E)`contains a triangle or cycle of length 3.*  
*- Give an `O(|V|3)` to find a triangle if one exists.*  
*- Improve your algorithm to run in time `O(|V|·|E|)`. You may assume `|V|≤|E|`*  
*Observe that these bounds gives you time to convert between the adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of `G`*

This can be done with DFS:
- Compare every possible set of 3 vertices and test if there is an edge between them
- Use DFS and maintain an array of parent and check any back edge `u-v` whether grandparent of `u` is equal to `v`
