### Exercise 5.8

-22 in a little-endian system is represented as `0xffffffea`, on a big-endian system this would be `0xeaffffff` or -352,321,537. A similar problem happens with -77 which is interpreted as -1,275,068,417 in big-endian. Adding these yields -1,627,068,417 which is interpreted as `0xf3ffff9e` or -16,777,314 in a little-endian system.
