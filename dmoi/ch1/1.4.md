### Exercises

#### 1.4.1
**Consider the question:** How many 3-letter words that start with `a` can you make with the alphabet $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ with letters that cannot be repeated?

**Answer 1:** Since `a` is selected, we have 3 choices for the second letter, and then 2 choices for the third letter, and thus $3 \cdot 2$ 3-letter words can be made.

**Answer 2:** Since `a` is selected, pick a remaining letter, say `b` and then you have 2 choices for the third letter. Now, pick another letter after `a`, say `c` this time, and you have 2 choices for the third letter (b or d). Repeat this one more time with `d` and the 2 choices left are `b` and `c`, and thus $2+2+2 = 3 \cdot 2$. Since these two answers are answers to the same question they must be equal, and thus $2+2+2 = 3 \cdot 2$


#### 1.4.2
a) $3 \cdot 4$, for each fez you get to pick one of the 4 bow-ties  
b) If we add our fezzes and bow-ties and choose 2 of any, then we must eliminate the instances in which we choose 2 fezzes and the instances in which we choose 2 bow-ties  
c) **Consider the question:** If you have `x` fezzes and `y` bow-ties, how many combinations can you make? You can only wear one fez and one bow-tie at a time.

**Answer 1:** For each fez you get to pick one of the 4 bow-ties and thus $xy$

**Answer 2:** Let's say we put our fezzes and bow-ties in a basket, and we pick 2 items (no matter which). Since we can only wear one bow-tie and one fez at a time, we cannot count the ways that we pick just 2 fezzes and the ways we pick just 2 bow-ties, and thus we can make $\binom{x+y}{2} - \binom{x}{2} - \binom{y}{2}$ combinations. Since these two answers are answers to the same question they must be equal, and thus $\binom{x+y}{2} - \binom{x}{2} - \binom{y}{2} = xy$


#### 1.4.3
a) $\binom{10}{3} + \binom{10}{8} + \binom{6}{3}$  
b) $\binom{12}{3} - \binom{7}{4}$  
c) **Consider the question:** How many triangles can you draw using the dots below as vertices?  
![dots](https://github.com/jonathantorres/bookshelf/blob/master/dmoi/img/dots.png)

**Answer 1:** Only 3 dots are used for each triangle, partition the dots into 3 groups, the first group will draw the triangles using a subset of 10 dots, the second group also uses a subset of 10 dots and the third group uses a subset of 6 dots, and thus we can draw $\binom{10}{3} + \binom{10}{8} + \binom{6}{3}$ triangles.

**Answer 2:** Count the triangles that can be made using all 12 dots and subtract the invalid triangles that are counted which use all of the dots from the `x` axis, and thus $\binom{12}{3} - \binom{7}{4}$ triangles can be drawn. Since these two answers are answers to the same question they must be equal, and thus $\binom{10}{3} + \binom{10}{8} + \binom{6}{3} = \binom{12}{3} - \binom{7}{4}$

#### 1.4.4
a) $\binom{11}{3} - \binom{10}{2}$, choose all combinations of triangles and subtract the invalid triangles that are formed using 3 dots from the same axis.  
b) $\binom{9}{2} + \binom{9}{3}$  
c) Binomial Identity $\binom{11}{3} - \binom{10}{2} = \binom{9}{2} + \binom{9}{3}$  


#### 1.4.5
a) $\binom{15}{6} \binom{6}{1}$  
b) $\binom{15}{1} \binom{14}{5}$  
c) We are choosing 6 bridesmaids out of 15 friends, for each combination of those we choose 1 out of the 6. This is the same as choosing the maid of honor out of the 15 friends, and for each combination, we choose the other 5 bridesmaids out of our 14 friends remaining.  


#### 1.4.6
a) Yes, this identity is true  
b) *TODO*  
c) **Consider the question:** You have 15 friends, but can only select 6 to go to the movies with, one of which needs to drive, in how many ways can you do this?

**Answer 1:** Choose 6 friends, this can be done in $\binom{15}{6}$ ways, for each combination, select the friend that needs to drive, in $\binom{6}{1}$ ways, and thus you can select your friends in $\binom{15}{6} \binom{6}{1}$ ways.

**Answer 2:** Select the friend that is going to drive first, you can do this in $\binom{15}{1}$ ways, for each combination select your 5 other friends out of the 14 left to choose from, this can be done in $\binom{14}{5}$ ways, and thus you can select your friends in $\binom{15}{1} \binom{14}{5}$ ways. Since these two answers are answers to the same question they must be equal, and thus $k \binom{n}{k} = n \binom{n-1}{k-1}$  


#### 1.4.7
**Consider the question:** You have 15 friends, but can only select 6 to go to the movies with, one of which drives the car and another that will pay for the tickets, in how many ways can you do this?

**Answer 1:** Choose 6 friends, this can be done in $\binom{15}{6}$ ways, for each combination, select the frind that will drive and the one that will pay, you can do this in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways, and thus you can select your friends in $\binom{15}{6} \binom{6}{2}$ ways.

**Answer 2:** Select the friend that is going to drive and the one that is going to pay first, you can do this in $\binom{15}{2}$ ways, for each combination select your other 4 friends that are going with you (out of the 13 left), this can be done in $\binom{13}{4}$ ways, and thus you can select your friends in $\binom{15}{2} \binom{13}{4}$ ways. Since these two answers are answers to the same question they must be equal, and thus $\binom{n}{2} \binom{n-2}{k-2} = \binom{n}{k} \binom{k}{2}$  


#### 1.4.8
**Consider the question:** You have a class of `n` students, some of them are going to an escape room, of those that are going, one needs to be the team captain, in how many ways can you do this?

**Answer 1:** Since we don't know how many of the `n` students are going to the escape room, we have to count for each possibility in `n` disjoint ways, first counting 1 of the 20 is going to the escape room, then count for 2 going, then 3 and so on, and thus this can be done in $\binom{n}{1} + 2 \binom{n}{2} + 3 \binom{n}{3} + \dots + n \binom{n}{n}$ ways.

**Answer 2:** Since we don't know how many of the `n` students are going to the escape room, we have to count every student and account for each being the captain of the group, or not being the captain, this can be done in $n 2^{n-1}$ ways. Since these two answers are answers to the same question they must be equal, and thus $\binom{n}{1} + 2 \binom{n}{2} + 3 \binom{n}{3} + \dots + n \binom{n}{n} = 2^{n-1}$


#### 1.4.9
**Consider the question:** You pizza parlor offers `n` toppings and an extra one on the weekends, you want a pizza with 2 toppings, how many ways different pizzas can you make?

**Answer 1:** If you are going on a weekend and you want a pizza with 2 toppings, then you can get $\binom{n+1}{2}$ different pizzas.

**Answer 2:** To count each possible selection of toppings, you get one extra topping on each day you visit, getting at least a pizza with 1 topping. After `n` visits you can get $1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n$ different pizzas. Since these two answers are answers to the same question they must be equal, and thus $1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n = \binom{n+1}{2}$


#### 1.4.10
a) $\binom{5}{1}$  
b) $\binom{4}{1}$  
c) $\binom{3}{1}$  
d) The ones that end with 1, 01 and 001  
e) $\binom{6}{2}$  
f) $\n-1 + n-2 + n-3 + \dots + 2 + 1 = \binom{n}{2}$  


#### 1.4.11
a) $3^n$  
b) $1$  
c) $3n$  
d) $3^2 n$  
e) $\binom{n}{k}$  
f) $2^n$  


#### 1.4.12
$\binom{9}{3} \binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{1} \binom{1}{1} = \binom{9}{2} \binom{7}{1} \binom{6}{1} \binom{5}{3} \binom{2}{2}$


#### 1.4.13
**Consider the question:** You go to a flower nursery, and you find `n` flower types, and 3 other kinds that are rare, how many different 5-flower bouquets can you make?

**Answer 1:** Pick 5 different flowers from your flower options (including the rare ones). This can be done in $\binom{n+3}{5}$ different ways.

**Answer 2:** Divide your flower options in two groups, the first group contains the rare ones, the other group the common ones and pick 2 flowers from each group and add one flower type to one group and remove one flower type from the other group. This can be done in $\binom{2}{2} \binom{n}{2} + \binom{3}{2} \binom{n-1}{2} + \binom{4}{2} \binom{n-2}{2} + \dots + \binom{n}{2} \binom{2}{2}$ different ways. Since these two answers are answers to the same question they must be equal, and thus $\binom{2}{2} \binom{n}{2} + \binom{3}{2} \binom{n-1}{2} + \binom{4}{2} \binom{n-2}{2} + \dots + \binom{n}{2} \binom{2}{2} = \binom{n+3}{5}$


#### 1.4.14
a) If you have a set of `n` different numbers, in how many ways you can enumerate all of the subsets of this set?
