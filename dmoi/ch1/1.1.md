## Counting
### Investigate!
1. a) 22 choices b) $8 \cdot 14 = 112$ choices
2. Enumerate every item (appetizers and entries) for b) I multiplied the amount of appetizers by the amount of entries
3. a) 38 ways b) 4 ways c) 312 ways


## Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion
### Investigate!
33 people enjoyed at least one of the kinds of pie. The answer is not 95 because we would be counting some people more than once


### Exercises

#### 1.1.1
$5 \cdot 3 \cdot 17$ or 255 different choices


#### 1.1.2
a) 8 choices for neck-wear  
b) 15 choices  
c) $5 \cdot (4+3)+7$ or 42 outfits  


#### 1.1.3
a) It's a movie night and you want to watch either a comedy or a horror movie, how many choices do you have?  
b) After watching an horror movie, you feel like watching all your comedies, how many movies have you watched after watching all your horror movies?  


#### 1.1.4
a) $16+16$ or 32 2-digit hexadecimals. 16 that start with E and 16 that start with F.  
b) Since we are only interested in the letters E and F and there are 16 different digits in hexadecimal then $16+16 = 16 \cdot 2$  
c) $6 \cdot 16 \cdot 10$ or 960 3-digit hexadecimals.  
d) $6 \cdot 16 \cdot 16$ that start with A-F and $16 \cdot 16 \cdot 10$ that end with a numeral, and we remove the duplicates $6 \cdot 16 \cdot 10$: $6 \cdot 16 \cdot 16 + 16 \cdot 16 \cdot 10 - 6 \cdot 16 \cdot 10 = 3,136$  


#### 1.1.5
a) 10  
b) 0  
c) $25,24,23 \dots 15$  


#### 1.1.6
13


#### 1.1.7
39 students watched at least one of the shows


#### 1.1.8
6 students hate potatoes. $15+20+9-12-5-6+3 = 24$. Since 24 of the students liked at least 1 style of potatoes, the other 6 must hate it


#### 1.1.9
215


#### 1.1.10
542 positive integers $333+199+142-66-47-28+9$


#### 1.1.11
a) $|(A \cup C) \setminus B| = 75$  
b) $|(A \cap C) \cup (B \cap C)| = 26$  


#### 1.1.12
a) $8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8$ or 32,768 words  
b) $8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4$ or 6,720 words  
c) 64 words  
d) 128 words  
e) 6,660 words  


#### 1.1.13
The sum of an ODD+ODD+EVEN will always yield an even number, we also have to consider zeros (100,110,310 etc.). $9 \cdot 9 \cdot 4 + (5 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 4) + 9 = 374$ 3-digit numbers that add up to an even number.


#### 1.1.14
$4 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 3$ or 120 divisors
