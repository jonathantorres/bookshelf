### Exercises
#### 2.3.1
$A_n = n^2 + n$


#### 2.3.2
$A_n = \frac{1}{6}(n^3+5n+6)$


#### 2.3.3
$A_n = \frac{1}{6}(n^3+6n^2+11n+12)$


#### 2.3.4
$A_n = \frac{1}{6}(n^3+6n^2+11n+18)$


#### 2.3.5
a) $0,3,9,18,30,45, \dots$  
b) $2,4,7,12,21,37,64,107, \dots$  
c) $1,2,4,8,16,32, \dots$  


#### 2.3.6
The closed formula will be quadratic because the sequence is $\Delta ^2$-constant. The formula for this sequence is $n^2-(n-1)$ where $n \geq 1$  


#### 2.3.7
$n^3+n^2-(n-1)$  


#### 2.3.8
$2n+4$  


#### 2.3.9
Let $B_n$ represent the sequence of differences of $A_n = An^2+bn+c$. Then the sequence of differences will have the closed formula $B_n = n(B_n-B_{n-1})+B_0$ for $n \geq 1$  


#### 2.3.10
No, the sequence of differences of $4,7,11,18,29,47, \dots$ will never be constant.  


#### 2.3.11
No, since it's an exponential function.
