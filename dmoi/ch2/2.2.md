## Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences
### Investigate!
- If `n=3` then $a_n = a_{n-1} + 4$
- If `n=3` then $a_n = a_{n-1} + 4n$
- If `n=5` then $a_n = a_{n-1} + n$


## Sums of Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences
### Investigate!
1. a) 510 Skittles. b) No, it will be left with 6 Skittles before it runs out
2. 710, it would have run out
3. 3,374


### Exercises
#### 2.2.1
a) $A_n = A_{n-1} + 4$ with $A_0 = 1$  
b) $A_n = A + 4n$  
c) Yes, 2013 is a term in the sequence since $2013 - 4 = 2009$ and thus $2009 - 4 = 2005$. If we add these terms with the terms in the beginning we get: $2013 + 1 = 2014$, $2009 + 5 = 2014$, $2005 + 9 = 2014$, $2001 + 13 = 2014$ which would indicate that 2013 is indeed part of the sequence.  
d) The sequence has 133 terms: $1 + 4(133) = 533$  
e) The sum is 35,777:
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{
    \begin{array}[b]{r}
      \left( S = 5+9+13+17+21+ \dots +533 \right)\\
      + \left( S = 533+529+525+521+517+ \dots +5 \right)
    \end{array}
  }{
    \left( 2S = 538+538+538+538+538+ \dots +538 \right)
  }
\end{equation}
```

Since the sequence has 133 terms: $538 \times 133 = 71,554$ and $71,554 \div 2 = 35,777$  
f) $b_n = 1 + \frac{(4n+6)n}{2}$  


#### 2.2.2
a) The next term is 32  
b) $A_n = 6n + 8$  
c) The sum is 30,500  


#### 2.2.3
a) The sum has 36 terms  
b) 4,554  


#### 2.2.4
a) $n+2$ terms  
b) $6(n-1) + 7$  
c) $\frac{(6n + 8)(n+2)}{2}$  

#### 2.2.5
68,117


#### 2.2.6
$\frac{5-5 \cdot 3^{21}}{-2}$  


#### 2.2.7
$\frac{1+ \frac{2^{31}}{3^{31}}}{\frac{5}{3}}$  


#### 2.2.8
- Arithmetic sequence: $x = 18.33$ $y = 9.66$  
- Geometric sequence: $x = 9$ $y = 3$  


#### 2.2.9
- Arithmetic sequence: $x = 14$ $y = 23$  
- Geometric sequence: $x = 10.56$ $y = 21.12$  


#### 2.2.10
- $(a,b) = (1,27)$  
- Arithmetic sequence: $1+9.66+18.33+27$  
- Geometric sequence: $1+3+9+27$  


#### 2.2.11
Partial sums of the sequence can be expressed as:  
$A_n = 2+5+8+11+14+ \dots +(5+3(n-1))$ or $3n+2$  
The closed formula for the sequence is:  
$A_n = \frac{4+(3n+7)n}{2}$  


#### 2.2.12
a) $6,10,16,26, \dots$  
b) $8,14,22,36, \dots$  
c) $A_n = A_{n-2} + A_{n-1}$ with $A_0 = 6$ and $A_1 = 10$  
$B_n = B_{n-2} + B_{n-1}$ with $B_0 = 8$ and $B_1 = 14$  
d) The are both the same as the Fibonnacci sequence, they are not arithmetic nor geometric.  


#### 2.2.13
a) $3,9,18,30,45, \dots$  
b) $t_n = t_{n-1} + 3n$ with $t_1 = 3$  
c) The sequence is not arithmetic nor geometric. It has an arithmetic sequence of partial sums of $3n+3$  
d)  
```math
\begin{equation}
\frac{
    \begin{array}[b]{r}
      \left( A_n = 3+6+9+12+15+ \dots + 3(n) \right)\\
      + \left( A_n = 3+3(n)+3(n-1)+3(n-2)+3(n-3)+ \dots + 6 \right)
    \end{array}
  }{
    \left( 2A_n = 6+6+3(n)+6+3(n)+6+3(n)+6+3(n)+ \dots + 6+3(n) \right)
  }
\end{equation}
```
Closed formula: $\frac{6+((6+3(n)) (n-1))}{2}$
