#### 0.4.10
a) 15  
b) 16  
c) 17  
d) 115  


#### 0.4.11
a) No, it's not injective $f(3) = 4$ and $f(6) = 4$  
b) No, it's not injective $f(5) = 4$ and $f(8) = 4$  
c) No, $f$ cannot be injective, the images start cycling as $4,2,1,4 \dots$ from $f(109)$  
d) Once a multiple of 4 is found in the range, the images start cycling as $4,2,1,4 \dots $. And so $f$ is not injective. At this point, I don't know how to prove this, not sure why the author wants me to prove something, without introducing proofs.

c) $\\{ \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3 \\} \dots \\{10\\} \\}$  
d) $\emptyset$

f) No, since the range of $f \subset \mathbb{N}$  


#### 0.4.15

#### 0.4.16
a) There is one element in $X$ whose image is 3, or such element does not exist  
b) There is at least one element in $X$ whose image is 3  
c) There is one element in $X$ whose image is 3  


#### 0.4.17
$X = \mathbb{N}$. $f:X \implies \mathbb{N}$ given by:  
```math
f(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    0   & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\
    1   & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
  \end{cases}
```


#### 0.4.18
a) $|X| \leq |Y|$. The domain cannot be larger than the codomain, otherwise a one-to-one relationship can't be established.  
b) The codomain must be a subset or equal to the range  
c) $|X| = |Y|$, since every element of the codomain is an image of exactly one elment of the domain  


#### 0.4.19
a) Possible if the codomain is larger than the domain and some elements are not in the range  
b) Possible if every element of the codomain maps to an element in the domain, even if there are duplicates  
c) Not possible, an element in the domain won't be mapped to an output if $f$ is not surjective  
d) Not possible, an element in the codomain won't be mapped to it's input unless $f$ is injective  
e) Not possible, an element in the domain won't be mapped to an output if $f$ is not surjective  
f) Not possible, an element in the codomain won't be mapped to it's input unless $f$ is injective  


#### 0.4.20
a) Yes, otherwise the range of $f$ won't be the same as the domain of $g$  
b) Yes, otherwise $Z$ won't be the same as the codomain of $g$  
c) Both $f$ and $g$ are injective and the range of $f$ is the same as the domain of $g$  
d) Both $f$ and $g$ are surjective  


#### 0.4.21
a) Yes, (don't know how to prove this, proofs have not been introducted)  
b) Yes, (don't know how to prove this, proofs have not been introducted)  


#### 0.4.22
Yes, it's a function. The domain is the students and the codomain is the grades. The function is not injective since more than one student can get the same grade, the function could be surjective if one student gets each grade. 


#### 0.4.23
Yes, it's a function. The domain is the 4 players and the codomain is the cards. The function is not injective since each player gets more than 1 card but the function is surjective since every card is dealt. 


#### 0.4.24
This is not a function


#### 0.4.25
$f(0) = 0; f(1) = 0; f(n+1) = f(n) + n$


#### 0.4.26
In general $|A| \geq |f(A)|$ since every input can only have one output. If the function is injective or bijective then $|A| = |f(A)|$


#### 0.4.27
In general there is no relationship between $|B|$ and $|f^{-1}(B)|$. If $f$ is injective then $|B| \geq |f^{-1}(B)|$, if $f$ is surjective $|B| \leq |f^{-1}(B)|$ and if $f$ is bijective then $|B| = |f^{-1}(B)|$


#### 0.4.28
a) Always, since every input is mapped to the same output  
b) Only sometimes, when $f$ is injective or bijective  
c) Equality always holds for bijective functions  


#### 0.4.29
a) Always, since every input is mapped to the same output  
b) Not always true, specifically if $f$ is neither injective and surjective  


#### 0.4.30
a) Not always, it always holds if $f$ is bijective or injective  
b) Not always, $B$ might contain elements that are not in the range of $f$
