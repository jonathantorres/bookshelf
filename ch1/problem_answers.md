#### P2
If L = 1000bits and R = 1Mbps then:
- 0.001 secs
- 0.002 secs
- 0.0N secs

#### P3
If R = 1Mbps and four packets are sent with sizes = {1,000, 2,000, 500 and 700}
- 0.0042 secs
- 0.0084 secs
- 0.0042 secs times N

#### P4
- 8 connections
- 4 connections
- No, it's not possible

#### P5
Approximately 1.8 seconds

#### P6
- d = m/s
- d = L/R
- d = N l/r
- In the router, waiting to be transmitted
- In the link
- Same, in the link, since the router just transmitted it
- 250 meters

#### P7
About 0.024 miliseconds, the other bits are still unprocessed

#### P8
- 20 users
- 10% chance
- N * 10% chance
- 30% chance

#### P9
- 400Kbps
- p times N/2

#### P10
I calculated 389.5ms

#### P11
Only the propagation totals, 362.5ms

#### P12
It would be `L n/r`. For that one packet it would be half of the transmission delay since the previous packet is halway done

#### P13
- L n/r
- Zero. Since the queue is empty every time that a packet arrives

#### P14
- I L/R * (P+T) where T is the transmission delay and P is the size of the packet

#### P15
`a/u`

#### P16
About 650 packets

#### P17
- d`-end-end` = N(proc+trans+prop)
- d`-end-end` = N(proc+trans+prop) * queue

#### P18
From Winnipeg to Florida:
- Average of 52ms
- In some cases it was 6 routers, in other 5
- I was able to find 2 different ISP's
- Compare with the 2 different continents

#### P19
Using Paris and Lyon -> Server in Miami:
- Not all, but 4 of the total 9
- None of them were in my run
- None

#### P20
M * min{Rc,Rs,R}
