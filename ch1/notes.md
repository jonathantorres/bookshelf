## Chapter 1 - Notes
- What is an algorithm?
- __**Heuristics?**__ Sounds like an hypotesis/guess
- TSP - Traveling Salesman Problem
- There is a fundamental difference between algorithms which always produce a correct result, and __**heuristics**__, which may usually do a good job but without providing any guarantee.
- Reasonable-looking algorithms can easily be incorrect. Algorithm correctness is a property that must be __**carefully demonstrated.**__
- The heart of any algorithm is an __**idea**__.
- An important techinque in algorithm design is to narrow the set of allowable instances until there is a correct and efficient algorithm.
- Searching for __**counter examples**__ is the best way to disprove the correctness of a __**heuristic.**__
