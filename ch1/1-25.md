*1.25 - A sorting algorithm takes 1 second to sort 1,000 items on your local machine. How long will it take to sort 10,000 items...*
- *a) If you believe that the algorithm takes time proportional to `n^2`, and*
- *b) If you believe that the algorithm takes time roughly proportional to `n log n`?*
***
It would depend on the algorithm.  
a) Proportional to `n^2`, 10 seconds on the worst case
