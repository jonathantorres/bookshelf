#### R1
They are connected together by a network of communication links. They are coaxial cables, copper wire, optical fiber and radio spectrum

#### R2
Wikipedia defines it as the etiquette of diplomacy and affairs of state. Also to an international agreement that supplements a treaty

#### R3
So that everyone agree on what each and every protocol does, so that people can create systems and products that interoperate

#### R4
- DSL: Home Access
- Cable: Home Access
- FTTH (Fiber): Home Access
- Ethernet: Enterprise Access
- WiFi: Enterprise Access
- 3G: Wide-area Access

#### R5
DSL is the digital subscribe line, it's mainly used for residential access. The residence obtains DSL from the same local telephone company, that provides it's wired local phone access

#### R6
- Cable: Up to 100Mbps, about $80 a month
- DSL: Up to 1000Mbps, starts at $14.95
- Fiber: Up to 1000Mbps, starts at $14.99

#### R7
100 Mbps for typical users and 1Gbps and up to 10Gbps for servers

#### R8
For 3G 1Mbps and about 10Mbps for 4G

#### R9
- Guided media: fiber optic cable, twisted pair copper wire or a coaxial cable
- Unguided media: Wireless LAX (WiFi) or a digital satellite channel

#### R10
- Geostationary Satellites: which remain above the same spot on Earth
- Low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites: which do not remain on one spot on Earth. They rotate around Earth and may communicate with each other, as well as with ground stations

#### R11
The end-to-end delay is `2 l/r`

#### R12
It stores packets that are waiting to be transmitted to the output link

#### R13
- Up to 10 users
- Because each user uses half of the 2Mbps link. Yes, one of the links will have to wait for one of the other two to finish
- There's a 40% chance that a user is transmitting at any given time
- When all 3 users are transmitting at the same time or every 25 seconds

#### R14
FDM the frecuency is divided up among the connections established in the link, for a TDM link time is divided into frames of a fixed duration and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots

#### R15
They created their own private TCP/IP network and they attempt to bypass the upper tiers by using lower tiers or connecting to upper tiers at IXP's. To reduce payments to upper-tier ISP's and for better control on how their services are provided to end users

#### R16
- Processing Delay - Constant
- Queuing Delay - Variable
- Transmission Delay - Variable
- Propagation Delay - Variable

#### R17
- Length 10km, Rate 100Mbps, Size 100 bytes
- Length 1000km, Rate 512Kbps, Size 500 bytes

#### R18
Approx. 0.01 seconds. It does not depend on packet length nor transmission rate

#### R19
- 500Kbps
- 8 seconds
- 100Kbps and 40 seconds

#### R20
It examines the IP address in the packet's header and it forwards it to the appropriate link. To find the shortest route possible

#### R21
500 and 300 packets respectively. Packet loss will occur with a high emission rate and a low transmission rate. If both are the same, packet loss will occur after a long period of time, depending on how long the router takes to transmit and forward every packet

#### R22
To provided a structured way to discuss system components. It also makes it easier to update system components (Hardware and Software)

#### R23
One disadvantage is that one layer may duplicate lower-layer functionallity

#### R24
They all refer to a packet of information but each layer uses encapsulation to add/interpret it's own details to the packet accross the network stack

#### R25
- Router: Network, Link, Physical
- Link layer switch: Link, Physical
- Host: Application, Transport, Network, Link, Physical

#### R26
After infecting one host, from that same host it seeks entry into other hosts over the internet and from the newly infected hosts, it seeks entry into yet more hosts

#### R27
By using malware, you can have a network of infected hosts and use them for the DDoS attack by blasting traffic at the target

#### R28
- Trudy is doing packet sniffing
- Trudy can make Alice think that she is Bob
- Trudy can make Bob think that she is Alice
- Trudy can see/modify the information that Bob and Alice are sharing
