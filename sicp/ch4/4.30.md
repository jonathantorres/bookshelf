### Exercise 4.30
- Every expression is evaluated using `eval`, and `display` is a primitive function so it will call `force-it` to get the parameter passed to `display`
- In the original `eval-sequence`, the values are `(cons 1 2)` and `1`. In Cy's proposed change, the values are `(cons 1 2)` and `(cons 1 2)`
- `(cdr items)` is passed as `actual-value` and not `eval`, it does not matter since they are forced anyways
- I would go with Cy's approach
