      (and (son ?grandfather ?father)
      (son ?father ?son)))

(rule (son ?father ?son)
      (and (wife ?father ?mother)

(rule (ends-with-grandson (?x . ?rest))
      (ends-with-grandson ?rest))

(rule ((grandson) ?grandfather ?grandson)
      (grandson ?grandfather ?grandson))

(rule ((great . ?rel) ?ancestor ?descendant)
      (and (ends-with-grandson ?rel)
      (son ?ancestor ?son-of-ancestor)
      (?rel ?son-of-ancestor ?descendant)))
```
