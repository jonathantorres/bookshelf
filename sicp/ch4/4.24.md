### Exercise 4.24
Running a few benchmarks with the `time` program in Linux, the performance of a `factorial` program (at least on my machine) were close:
```bash
# running the original evaluator
real    0m0.194s
user    0m0.232s
sys     0m0.017s

# running the evaluator with syntactic analysis
real    0m0.195s
user    0m0.232s
sys     0m0.026s
```
