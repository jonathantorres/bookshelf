### Exercise 4.64
At first, the query system will give the answer `(outranked-by (Bitdiddle Ben) (Warbucks Oliver))`

This is returned because it matches an existing assertion. Then the system will match `(outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss)` which applies the same rule again. This match gets all supervisor assertions, which then will try to match `(outranked-by ?staff_person ?boss)` and enter an infinite loop.
