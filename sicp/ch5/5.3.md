### Exercise 5.3

Data path for `sqrt` using `good-enough?` and `improve` as primitives. The `g` register will hold the answer of the computation:

Controller definition for `sqrt` using `good-enough?` and `improve` as primitives:
```
(controller
  (assign g (const 1.0))
sqrt-test
  (test (op good-enough?) (reg g) (reg x))
  (branch (label sqrt-done))
  (assign g (op improve) (reg g) (reg x))
  (goto (label sqrt-test))
sqrt-done)
```

Data path for `sqrt` with arithmetic operations. I left `average` and `abs` as primitives. The `g` register will hold the answer of the computation:

Controller definition for `sqrt` with arithmetic operations:
```
(controller
  (assign g (const 1.0))
sqrt-test
  (assign t1 (op mul) (reg g) (reg g))
  (assign t1 (op sub) (reg t1) (reg x))
  (assign t1 (op abs) (reg t1))
  (test (op <) (reg t1) (const 0.001))
  (branch (label sqrt-done))
  (assign t2 (op div) (reg x) (reg g))
  (assign g (op avg) (reg g) (reg t2))
  (goto (label sqrt-test))
sqrt-done)
```
