### Exercise 5.51
A rudimentary implementation of Scheme. It's a direct translation of the Explicit Control Evaluator from section 5.4

### Compile
Compile the program using the `go` toolchain and `make`. This would create the `scm` binary inside the `bin` directory
```bash
$ make
```

### Usage
After compiling, run a Scheme program by creating a file and running the interpreter with this file:
```bash
./bin/scm test.scm
```
