### Exercise 2.63
a. Yes, it will always return a list in sorted order. Both functions return the same list `(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)` on all of the trees illustrated.  
b. No, `tree->list-1` executes in `O(n log n)` due to the call to the `append` procedure and `tree->list-2` executes in `O(n)` since `cons` is a constant time procedure.
