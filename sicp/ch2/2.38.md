### Exercise 2.38
- `(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))` = 3/2
- `(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))` = 1/6
- `(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))` = `(1 (2 (3 ())))`
- `(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))` = `(((() 1) 2) 3)`
- `op` must be commutative, meaning that the order of the operands does not change the result
