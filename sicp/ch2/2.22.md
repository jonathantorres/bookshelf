### Exercise 2.22
- Each time we go through the loop we add every `square`d number to the `answer` list by inserting this new value at the front of the list. Once the loop is finished every `square`d number appears in the `answer` list in the reversed order that we looped through.
- This version won't create the list in the correct way (and still in the wrong order), the `car` of the pair contains the pointer to the next element and the `cdr` contains the value of that pair.
