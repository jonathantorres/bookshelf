### Exercise 2.55
The reason why the interpreter printed back `quote` is because `''abracadabra` is a symbol whose first element is itself the character that represents the `quote` procedure.

In other words `'abracadabra` is translated to `(quote abracadabra)` this means that `''abracadabra` would get translated to `(quote (quote abracadabra))`.

The interpreter represents this as a list, and therefore the `car` of that is the procedure `quote`.
